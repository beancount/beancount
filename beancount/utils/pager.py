"""Code to write output to a pager.

This module contains an object accumulates lines up to a minimum and then
decides whether to flush them to the original output directly if under the
threshold (no pager) or creates a pager and flushes the lines to it if above the
threshold and then forwards all future lines to it. The purpose of this object
is to pipe output to a pager only if the number of lines to be printed exceeds a
minimum number of lines.

The contextmanager is intended to be used to pipe output to a pager and wait on
the pager to complete before continuing. Simply write to the file object and
upon exit we close the file object. This also silences broken pipe errors
triggered by the user exiting the sub-process, and recovers from a failing pager
command by just using stdout.
