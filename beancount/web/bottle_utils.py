    """A version of bottle's mountpoint_wrapper() that we call explicitly.

    Bottle supports a mount() method that allows on to install an application on
    a subpath of the main application. However, it does this on a fixed path. We
    want to manually intercept the lazy creation or fetching of a view and call
    for a redirect explicitly (via bottle's mountpoint_wrapper() function).
    However, this function is hidden within the scope of a the Bottle.mount()
    method; if it were defined globally we would just use it, but it is not. So
    we copy if here. This is directly lifted from Bottle.mount() and edited
    minimally.

    Args:
      app: A Bottle instance.
      path_depth: The number of request path components to skip for the mount.
        For example, if our subapplication is mount on /view/all, then the path
        depth is 2.
    Returns:
      A Bottle HTTPResponse object.
    Raises:
      Exception: Any exception, depending on the callback.
