"""Insert a balance check for zero before balance sheets accounts are closed.

For balance sheet accounts with a Close directive (Assets, Liabilities &
Equity), insert Balance directives just after its closing date, for all the
commodities that have appeared in that account and that are declared as legal on
it as well. This performs the equivalent of the following transformation:

    2018-02-01 open  Assets:Project:Cash      USD,CAD
    ...
    2020-02-01 close Assets:Project:Cash

to:
    2018-02-01 open  Assets:Project:Cash      USD,CAD
    ...

    2020-02-01 close Assets:Project:Cash
    2020-02-02 balance Assets:Project:Cash    0 USD
    2020-02-02 balance Assets:Project:Cash    0 CAD
