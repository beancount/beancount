"""A plugin that issues errors when more than one commodity is used in an account.

For investments or trading accounts, it can make it easier to filter the action
around a single stock by using the name of the stock as the leaf of the account
name.

Notes:

- The plugin will automatically skip accounts that have explicitly declared
  commodities in their Open directive.

- You can also set the metadata "onecommodity: FALSE" on an account's Open
  directive to skip the checks for that account.

- If provided, the configuration should be a regular expression restricting the
  set of accounts to check.
