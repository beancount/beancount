    """Check that all accounts declared open are actually used.

    We check that all of the accounts that are open are at least referred to by
    another directive. These are probably unused, so issue a warning (we like to
    be pedantic). Note that an account that is open and then closed is
    considered used--this is a valid use case that may occur in reality. If you
    have a use case for an account to be open but never used, you can quiet that
    warning by initializing the account with a balance asserts or a pad
    directive, or even use a note will be sufficient.

    plugin.)
