"""A plugin that issues errors when amounts are posted to non-leaf accounts,
that is, accounts with child accounts.

This is an extra constraint that you may want to apply optionally. If you
install this plugin, it will issue errors for all accounts that have
postings to non-leaf accounts. Some users may want to disallow this and
enforce that only leaf accounts may have postings on them.
