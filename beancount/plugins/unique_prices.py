"""This module adds validation that there is a single price defined per
date and base/quote currencies. If multiple conflicting price values are
declared, an error is generated. Note that multiple price entries with the
same number do not generate an error.

This is meant to be turned on if you want to use a very strict mode for
entering prices, and may not be realistic usage. For example, if you have
(1) a transaction with an implicitly generated price during the day (from
its cost) and (2) a separate explicit price directive that declares a
different price for the day's closing price, this would generate an error.
I'm not certain this will be useful in the long run, so placing it in a
plugin.
