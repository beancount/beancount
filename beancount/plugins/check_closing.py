"""A plugin that automatically inserts a balance check on a tagged closing posting.

Some postings are known to the user to be "closing trades", which means that the
resulting position of the instrument just after the trade should be zero. For
instance, this is the case for most ordinary options trading, only one lot of a
particular instrument is held, and eventually expires or gets sold off in its
entirely. One would like to confirm that, and the way to do this in Beancount is
to insert a balance check.

This plugin allows you to do that more simply, by inserting metadata. For
example, this transaction:

    2018-02-16 * "SOLD -14 QQQ 100 16 FEB 18 160 CALL @5.31"
      Assets:US:Brokerage:Main:Options     -1400 QQQ180216C160 {2.70 USD} @ 5.31 USD
        closing: TRUE
      Expenses:Financial:Commissions       17.45 USD
      Expenses:Financial:Fees               0.42 USD
      Assets:US:Brokerage:Main:Cash      7416.13 USD
      Income:US:Brokerage:Main:PnL

Would expand into the following two directives:

    2018-02-16 * "SOLD -14 QQQ 100 16 FEB 18 160 CALL @5.31"
      Assets:US:Brokerage:Main:Options     -1400 QQQ180216C160 {2.70 USD} @ 5.31 USD
      Expenses:Financial:Commissions       17.45 USD
      Expenses:Financial:Fees               0.42 USD
      Assets:US:Brokerage:Main:Cash      7416.13 USD
      Income:US:Brokerage:Main:PnL

    2018-02-17 balance Assets:US:Brokerage:Main:Options  0 QQQ180216C160

Insert the closing line when you know you're closing the position.
