"""An implementation of currency accounts.

This is an automatic implementation of the method described here:
https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html

You enable it just like this:

    plugin "beancount.plugins.currency_accounts" "Equity:CurrencyAccounts"

Accounts will be automatically created under the given base account, with the
currency name appended to it, e.g.,

    Equity:CurrencyAccounts:CAD
    Equity:CurrencyAccounts:USD

etc., where used. You can have a look at the account balances with a query like
this:

    bean-query $L "select account, sum(position), convert(sum(position), 'USD')
                   where date >= 2018-01-01 and  account ~ 'CurrencyAccounts' "

The sum total of the converted amounts should be a number not too large:

    bean-query $L "select convert(sum(position), 'USD')
                   where date >= 2018-01-01 and  account ~ 'CurrencyAccounts'"

WARNING: This is a prototype. Note the FIXMEs in the code below, which indicate
some potential problems.
