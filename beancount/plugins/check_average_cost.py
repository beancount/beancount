"""A plugin that ensures cost basis is preserved in unbooked transactions.

This is intended to be used in accounts using the "NONE" booking method, to
manually ensure that the sum total of the cost basis of reducing legs matches
the average of what's in the account inventory. This is a partial first step
toward implementing the "AVERAGE" booking method. In other words, this plugins
provides assertions that will constrain you to approximate what the "AVERAGE"
booking method will do, manually, and not to leak too much cost basis through
unmatching bookings without checks. (Note the contrived context here: Ideally
the "NONE" booking method would simply not exist.)
