"""A plugin that automatically converts postings at price to postings held at
cost, applying an automatic booking algorithm in assigning the cost bases and
matching lots.

This plugin restricts itself to applying these transformations within a
particular account, which you provide. For each of those accounts, it also
requires a corresponding Income account to book the profit/loss of reducing
lots (i.e., sales):

  plugin "beancount.plugins.book_conversions" "Assets:Bitcoin,Income:Bitcoin"

Then, simply input the transactions with price conversion. We use "Bitcoins" in
this example, converting Bitcoin purchases that were carried out as currency
into maintaining these with cost basis, for tax reporting purposes:

  2015-09-04 * "Buy some bitcoins"
    Assets:Bank          -1000.00 USD
    Assets:Bitcoin       4.333507 BTC @ 230.76 USD

  2015-09-05 * "Buy some more bitcoins at a different price"
    Assets:Bank          -1000.00 USD
    Assets:Bitcoin       4.345747 BTC @ 230.11 USD

  2015-09-20 * "Use (sell) some bitcoins"
    Assets:Bitcoin       -6.000000 BTC @ 230.50 USD
    Expenses:Something

The result is that cost bases are inserted on augmenting lots:

  2015-09-04 * "Buy some bitcoins"
    Assets:Bitcoin  4.333507 BTC {230.76 USD} @ 230.76 USD
    Assets:Bank     -1000.00 USD

  2015-09-05 * "Buy some more bitcoins at a different price"
    Assets:Bitcoin  4.345747 BTC {230.11 USD} @ 230.11 USD
    Assets:Bank     -1000.00 USD

While on reducing lots, matching FIFO lots are automatically found and the
corresponding cost basis added:

  2015-09-20 * "Use (sell) some bitcoins"
    Assets:Bitcoin          -4.333507 BTC {230.76 USD} @ 230.50 USD
    Assets:Bitcoin          -1.666493 BTC {230.11 USD} @ 230.50 USD
    Income:Bitcoin         0.47677955 USD
    Expenses:Something  1383.00000000 USD

Note that multiple lots were required to fulfill the sale quantity here. As in
this example, this may result in multiple lots being created for a single one.

Finally, Beancount will eventually support booking methods built-in, but this is
a quick method that shows how to hack your own booking method via
transformations of the postings that run in a plugin.

Implementation notes:

- This code uses the FIFO method only for now. However, it would be very easy to
  customize it to provide other booking methods, e.g. LIFO, or otherwise. This
  will be added eventually, and I'm hoping to reuse the same inventory
  abstractions that will be used to implement the fallback booking methods from
  the booking proposal review (http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-booking).

- Instead of keeping a list of (Position, Transaction) pairs for the pending
  FIFO lots, we really ought to use a beancount.core.inventory.Inventory
  instance. However, the class does not contain sufficient data to carry out
  FIFO booking at the moment. A newer implementation, living in the "booking"
  branch, does, and will be used in the future.

- This code assumes that a positive number of units is an augmenting lot and a
  reducing one has a negative number of units, though we never call them that
  way on purpose (to eventually allow this code to handle short positions). This
  is not strictly true; however, we would need an Inventory in order to figrue
  this out. This will be done in the future and is not difficult to do.


IMPORTANT:

  This plugin was developed before the booking methods (FIFO, LIFO, and others)
  were fully implemented in Beancount. It was built to answer a question on the
  mailing-list about FIFO booking. You probably don't need to use them anymore.
  Always prefer to use the native syntax instead of this.
