"""Compress multiple entries into a single one.

This can be used during import to compress the effective output, for accounts
with a large number of similar entries. For example, I had a trading account
which would pay out interest every single day. I have no desire to import the
full detail of these daily interests, and compressing these interest-only
entries to monthly ones made sense. This is the code that was used to carry this
out.

def compress(entries, predicate):
    """Compress multiple transactions into single transactions.

    Replace consecutive sequences of Transaction entries that fulfill the given
    predicate by a single entry at the date of the last matching entry.
    'predicate' is the function that determines if an entry should be
    compressed.

    This can be used to simply a list of transactions that are similar and occur
    frequently. As an example, in a retail FOREX trading account, differential
    interest of very small amounts is paid every day; it is not relevant to look
    at the full detail of this interest unless there are other transactions. You
    can use this to compress it into single entries between other types of
    transactions.

    Args:
      entries: A list of directives.
      predicate: A callable which accepts an entry and return true if the entry
          is intended to be compressed.
    Returns:
      A list of directives, with compressible transactions replaced by a summary
      equivalent.
