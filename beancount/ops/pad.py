def pad(entries, options_map):
    """Insert transaction entries for to fulfill a subsequent balance check.

    Synthesize and insert Transaction entries right after Pad entries in order
    to fulfill checks in the padded accounts. Returns a new list of entries.
    Note that this doesn't pad across parent-child relationships, it is a very
    simple kind of pad. (I have found this to be sufficient in practice, and
    simpler to implement and understand.)

    Furthermore, this pads for a single currency only, that is, balance checks
    are specified only for one currency at a time, and pads will only be
    inserted for those currencies.

    Args:
      entries: A list of directives.
      options_map: A parser options dict.
    Returns:
      A new list of directives, with Pad entries inserted, and a list of new
      errors produced.
