"""Validation checks.

These checks are intended to be run after all the plugins have transformed the
list of entries, just before serving them or generating reports from them. The
idea is to ensure a reasonable set of invariants and generate errors if those
invariants are violated. They are not sanity checks--user data is subject to
constraints which are hopefully detected here and which will result in errors
trickled up to the user.
