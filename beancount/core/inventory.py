"""A container for an inventory of positions.

This module provides a container class that can hold positions. An inventory is
a mapping of positions, where each position is keyed by

  (currency: str, cost: Cost) -> position: Position

where

  'currency': The commodity under consideration, USD, CAD, or stock units such
     as HOOL, MSFT, AAPL, etc.;

  'cost': None or a Cost instance existing of cost currency, number, date, and
     label;

  'position': A Position object, whose 'units' attribute is guaranteed to have
    the same currency as 'currency' and whose 'cost' attribute is equal to the
    'cost' key. It basically stores the number of units.

This is meant to accommodate both booked and non-booked amounts. The clever
trick that we pull to do this is that for positions which aren't booked, we
simply leave the 'cost' as None. This is the case for most of the transactions.

= Conversions =

If it often desired to convert this inventory into an equivalent position for
its cost, or to just flatten all the positions with the same currency and count
the number of units, or to compute the market value for the inventory at a
specific date. You do these conversions using the reduce() method:

  inventory.reduce(convert.get_cost)
  inventory.reduce(convert.get_units)
  inventory.reduce(convert.get_value, price_map, date)
