def infer_tolerances(postings, options_map, use_cost=None):
    """Infer tolerances from a list of postings.

    The tolerance is the maximum fraction that is being used for each currency
    (a dict). We use the currency of the weight amount in order to infer the
    quantization precision for each currency. Integer amounts aren't
    contributing to the determination of precision.

    The 'use_cost' option allows one to experiment with letting postings at cost
    and at price influence the maximum value of the tolerance. It's tricky to
    use and alters the definition of the tolerance in a non-trivial way, if you
    use it. The tolerance is expanded by the sum of the cost times a fraction 'M'
    of the smallest digits in the number of units for all postings held at cost.

    For example, in this transaction:

        2006-01-17 * "Plan Contribution"
          Assets:Investments:VWELX 18.572 VWELX {30.96 USD}
          Assets:Investments:VWELX 18.572 VWELX {30.96 USD}
          Assets:Investments:Cash -1150.00 USD

    The tolerance for units of USD will calculated as the MAXIMUM of:

      0.01 * M = 0.005 (from the 1150.00 USD leg)

      The sum of
        0.001 * M x 30.96 = 0.01548 +
        0.001 * M x 30.96 = 0.01548
                          = 0.03096

    So the tolerance for USD in this case is max(0.005, 0.03096) = 0.03096. Prices
    contribute similarly to the maximum tolerance allowed.

    Note that 'M' above is the inferred_tolerance_multiplier and its default
    value is 0.5.

    Args:
      postings: A list of Posting instances.
      options_map: A dict of options.
      use_cost: A boolean, true if we should be using a combination of the smallest
        digit of the number times the cost or price in order to infer the tolerance.
        If the value is left unspecified (as 'None'), the default value can be
        overridden by setting an option.
    Returns:
      A dict of currency to the tolerated difference amount to be used for it,
      e.g. 0.005.
