    """Project all prices with a quote currency to another quote currency.

    Say you have a price for HOOL in USD and you'd like to convert HOOL to CAD.
    If there aren't any (HOOL, CAD) price pairs in the database it will remain
    unconverted. Projecting from USD to CAD will compute combined rates and
    insert corresponding prices over all base currencies (like HOOL). In this
    example, each of the (HOOL, USD) prices would see an inserted (HOOL, CAD)
    price inserted at the same date.

    It is common to make these projections when reducing inventories in a ledger
    that states multiple operating currency pairs, when for example, one wants
    to compute total value of a set of accounts in one of those currencies.

    Please note that:

    - Even if the target pair has existing entries, projection will still be
      applied. For example, is there exist some (HOOL, CAD) prices, the
      projection in the example above will still insert some new price points to
      it.

    - However, projected prices colliding existing ones at the same date will
      not override them.

    - Projection will fail to insert a new price if the conversion between to
      and from currencies has no existing prices (e.g. before its first price
      entry).

    - Perhaps most importantly, we only insert price points at dates where the
      base commodity has a price point. In other words, if we have prices for
      dates A and C and the rate changes between these dates at date B, we don't
      synthesize a new price at date B. A more accurate method to get projected
      prices that takes into account varying rates is to do multiple lookups.
