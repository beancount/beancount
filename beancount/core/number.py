"""The module contains the basic Decimal type import.

About Decimal usage:

- Do not import Decimal from the 'decimal' or 'cdecimal' modules; always import
  your Decimal class from beancount.core.amount.

- Prefer to use D() to create new instances of Decimal objects, which
  handles more syntax, e.g., handles None, and numbers with commas.

# Note: Python 3.3 is supposed to guarantee a fast "C" decimal implementation,
# as it comes with its source code. However, in practice, many distributions,
# including the popular Ubuntu distro, simply don't compile it. Other distros
# (e.g., Arch Linux) insist on breaking up Python into multiple packages in
# order to manage the dependency to the mpdec library, and make that
# installation optional. Moreover, there seems to have been changes in the
# dispatching of pure-Python and fast C decimal implementations in Python-3.5's
# source code itself. The result is that despite Python-3.3 or above being
# installed, a fast C decimal implementation may or may not be present. Thus, we
# must detect it here. I believe this subtle problem should go away with
# Python-3.5 and above.
#
# What do we do? We import the default 'decimal' module, and if it's the pure
# Python implementation, we attempt to import an explicitly installed
# 'cdecimal', which you can install with
