# An "event value change" directive. These directives are used as string
# variables that have different values over time. You can use these to track an
# address, your location, your current employer, anything you like. The kind of
# reporting that is made of these generic events is based on days and a
# timeline. For instance, if you need to track the number of days you spend in
# each country or state, create a "location" event and whenever you travel, add
# an event directive to indicate its new value. You should be able to write
# simple scripts against those in order to compute if you were present somewhere
# for a particular number of days. Here's an illustrative example usage, in
# order to maintain your health insurance coverage in Canada, you need to be
# present in the country for 183 days or more, excluding trips of less than 30
# days. There is a similar test to be done in the US by aliens to figure out if
# they need to be considered as residents for tax purposes (the so-called
# "substantial presence test"). By integrating these directives into your
# bookkeeping, you can easily have a little program that computes the tests for
# you. This is, of course, entirely optional and somewhat auxiliary to the main
# purpose of double-entry bookkeeping, but correlates strongly with the
# transactions you insert in it, and so it's a really convenient thing to have
# in the same input file.

# resolution, it makes no sense to have multiple price directives at the same
# date. (Beancount will not attempt to solve this problem; this is beyond the
# general scope of double-entry bookkeeping and if you need to build a day
# trading system, you should probably use something else).

# A document file declaration directive. This directive is used to attach a
# statement to an account, at a particular date. A typical usage would be to
# render PDF files or scans of your bank statements into the account's journal.
# While you can explicitly create those directives in the input syntax, it is
# much more convenient to provide Beancount with a root directory to search for
