"""Conversions from Position (or Posting) to units, cost, weight, market value.

  * Units: Just the primary amount of the position.
  * Cost: The cost basis of the position, if available.
  * Weight: The cost basis or price of the position.
  * Market Value: The units converted to a value via a price map.

To convert an inventory's contents, simply use these functions in conjunction
with ``Inventory.reduce()``, like

    cost_inv = inv.reduce(convert.get_cost)

This module equivalently converts Position and Posting instances. Note that
we're specifically avoiding to create an import dependency on
beancount.core.data in order to keep this module isolatable, but it works on
postings due to duck-typing.

Function named ``get_*()`` are used to compute values from postings to their price currency.
Functions named ``convert_*()`` are used to convert postings and amounts to any currency.
