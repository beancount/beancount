"""Realization of specific lists of account postings into reports.

This code converts a list of entries into a tree of RealAccount nodes (which
stands for "realized accounts"). The RealAccount objects contain lists of
Posting instances instead of Transactions, or other entry types that are
attached to an account, such as a Balance or Note entry.

The interface of RealAccount corresponds to that of a regular Python dict, where
the keys are the names of the individual components of an account's name, and
the values are always other RealAccount instances. If you want to get an account
by long account name, there are helper functions in this module for this purpose
(see realization.get(), for instance). RealAccount instances also contain the
final balance of that account, resulting from its list of postings.

You should not build RealAccount trees yourself; instead, you should filter the
list of desired directives to display and call the realize() function with them.
