beancount: TODO
* V3 / C++

- TODO(blais): Setup ASSERT() as a stream.
- Replace absl/strings/string_view.h to <string_view>

- Contemplate removing Ledger and the beancount::Ledger proto. Do we really need
  both? Measure performance and use cases and eliminate one or the other.

- Establish a distinction between strings and currencies in data type in Python;
  this allows us to process metadata correctly. See this plugin for a use case:
  beancount.plugins.check_commodity

- Review and test pointer ownership and leakage. This parser does not currently
  apply much rigor on reclaiming memory.

- In options `plugin_processing_mode`:

    TODO(blais): Make the default include all the core plugins, as PEDANTIC.
    Let that be the default. Make DEFAULT some other name. V3 should include
    all the pedantry by default.

** Reminders

- It would be great to be able to file a reminder of payment directive, and
  somehow for bean-check to warn you to file those when within a certain time
  frame, e.g., 30 days.


** For API

- Inventory: Add a function to discard by currency.
- Inventory: Make it easier to reduce & convert to a single currency.


* Priorities

- Fix #145

booking_full.py: # FIXME: Refactor compute_cost_number() and convert_costspec_to_cost().

- Start versioning very soon. It's desired by users.

- Pivot report... very useful. I need it.
- Pull request for Unicode support: https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/pull-requests/13/allow-unicode-in-account-names/diff#comment-20233638
- Fix #128
- Fix #130

* Returns (Revision)

  - Fix remaining tests for removal of open/balance entries from segment_periods().

  - Implement per account, with data structures + code to combine them together
  - Trailing windows
  - Rolling windows
  - Calculate pre-tax returns, post-tax returns
  - Output nice debugging information
  - Warn when prices aren't within a certain date interval with their usage
  - Render a graph of the actual values of the assets as well.
  - There should be a separate web application that handles this, no need to
    pre-render everything.
  - You need to merge the external entries when multiple ones occur on the same
    date.
  - Handle the various FIXMEs.

* Settlement Dates (Split & Merge)

  In http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-settlement, I describe the problem
  of merging two half-transactions that occur at different dates, pulled by
  importing from two different accounts into a single one. I also discuss that
  this problem is dual to that of providing a way to input a single transaction
  with legs posting at different dates. These two problems are related and will
  be dealt together by providing additions to the syntax and some plugins as
  well.

  - Including the email thread with mharris & redstreet0 in the settlement doc.

  - Review all the documentation to convert "transfer account" to "clearing
    account" everywhere; that's the correct name for this idea (thanks Filippo).

  - Limbo accounts: Start a document on handling limbo accounts, summarize all
    info from emails. (BTW, these are called "Clearing Accounts"; rename all docs)

  - You need to be able to support a single transaction that gets amortized over
    time.

** Dated Postings

  - In order to create multiple similar transactions at many dates in one
    syntax' entry, you could allow overriding the date on each posting, e.g.:

       2013-04-01 * Blah di bla
         2013-01-01  Grocery          10 USD
         2013-02-01  Grocery          10 USD
         2013-03-01  Grocery          10 USD
         Cash

    This would create three transactions, with these dates:

        date           aux-date
        2013-01-01     2013-04-01     10 / 3.33
        2013-02-01     2013-04-01     ...
        2013-03-01     2013-04-01     ...

    Could be a nice way to make distributed transactions.

  - Move 'effective date' to the postings in my input file, using the dated
    postings feature.

  - Another idea would be to make @pad able to pad for a percentage of the
    total, so that we're able to use @pad instead of "distribution of expenses"
    entries.

* Exporting Data

  Beancount has various reports and export mechanisms, but there remain several
  flaws. I want to address some of these urgently.

  - Implement output to XLS as well.

  - Complete the export of holdings to a Google Spreadsheet and completely
    replace my usage of Google Finance for intra-day reporting. Part of this
    work should result in the ability to produce a spreadsheet of various
    aggregations of dimensions on each stock, e.g., report intra-day movement in
    small, mid and large cap stock positions separately.

  - Idea: Export the Posting table to a Spreadsheet equivalent, as a single list
    of postings, joining transactions by an id column. That should quiet down
    those who think you can do this with a Spreadsheet to try it out for
    themselves.

  - Write a script that, given my portfolio of ETFs, will compute the total
    exposure of AMZN (or any other stock contained within the ETF) of the entire
    portfolio value. In other words, sum up the components of individual stocks
    across all ETFs and mutual funds, and reaggregate by those individual
    stocks. I believe that there is much overlap.

* Documentation

  I have a number of documents pending to release, some of which for part of the
  Benacount Cookbook which exists to provide guidance on selecting accounts and
  methods to book various things.

  Tasks:

  - "Introduction to Double-Entry Booking." The most important one is this intro
    doc. I have a very clear idea of how I want to present this, but for some
    reason I've written everything else and left this for last. I had a couple
    of shots at it but never really finished it. This document will also contain
    a section to explain how inventories "work", that is, how amounts posted to
    them are matched against their existing contents. Complete this doc first.
    {write-intro-doc}

  - "Cookbook: Taxes." I have a nearly complete cookbook document on booking
    taxes. It's timely [April 2016] and I should try to complete that now for
    this reason.

  - "Cookbook: Health Care". I have a nearly complete cookbook document on
    booking health-care costs. Tracking health-case costs in the US has caused
    me headaches occasionally but I've managed to come up with a nice framework
    for doing so. I need to finish this document to share this. (Ideally with
    DEDUC and COPAY legs explanation. Write an accompanying plugin to insert the
    deductible tracking and what-not.)

  - "Property sale example." Beancount was begun shortly after buying my first
    real-estate property (a condominium loft in Montreal). Because of this, I
    tracked _all_ related expenses in Beancount and I'd like to build an example
    script which processes my transactions to extract just those and finally
    calculate the precise return on the property, including every single little
    tidbit that was spent on it. My goal is to demonstrate that although at face
    value a profit was made, when you account for all the details you realize
    that the true return is much smaller--even potentially a loss. Part of the
    work here involves ensuring that all the input numbers can be pulled out of
    Beancount directly, without using a spreadsheet. I think that doig this
    might require some custom scripting and I intended for this use case to
    become an example of writing scripts against the Beancount API.

  - Write a worked and detailed example of generating automated transactions in
    the Plugins document.

  - Make sure this doc is linked from somewhere:
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-rounding

  - Create an index page of all the possible reports, from the web page.

  - Write more on saving, "Climbing the Capital Mountain."

  - Summarize Ledger's --limit --real --virtual --equity, etc. options.

  - Write a doc about how conceptually Beancount's data is really just a single
    large joined table of Transactions JOIN Postings with some repeated fields
    for inventory and tags, some data types for Amount and Inventory along with
    accompanying functions to deal with those types. This could really help a
    lot of people understand the framework for extracting data from Beancount.

** Misc Documentation Tasks

  - Write a script to automatically convert and upload the docs for the shell
    functions and what-not into a Google Docs that we can open with a web
    browser. Write a script to spit it out in a nice format and upload.

  - In the comparison doc: describe how Beancount has asset types

  - Comparison w/ Ledger doc: "balance sheet and closing of year"

  - Write a document that explains how to convert to and from Ledger and/or
    HLedger.

  - Complete "How Inventories Work?"

  - Complete intro document on double-entry bookkeepingk."
  - Complete Design Doc

  - Change documentation script to try to download to ODT format and then batch
    format to ebook

  - You should have a dedicated section of your document that explains how market
    values are reported, that is, via the unrealized gains plugin. Also provide a
    market() function, to value holdings.

  - Finally bake a PDF of all GDocs documentation and add a link to it. Should
    be mobile-friendly.




  - Merge "Getting Started with Beancount" & "Tutorial & Example" into a single
    document. See comments from:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w5wWVFuPe6H2Aeex8iqCL8YfAO6xNZgzmrnRNlvxJec/

  - Merge "A Comparison of Beancount, Ledger & HLedger" & "Beancount History &
    Credits" documents into one. See comments from:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w5wWVFuPe6H2Aeex8iqCL8YfAO6xNZgzmrnRNlvxJec/

  - Move the "spreadsheet / mint / quicken / quickbooks / gnucash / sql"
    comparison bit out of the "Motivation" document into the "Comparison" document.
    See comments from:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w5wWVFuPe6H2Aeex8iqCL8YfAO6xNZgzmrnRNlvxJec/

  - Make the four extraction methods clear, create a "part" for the four docs.

  - Document average cost inventory booking; in doing so, include this example
    from yegle:

       "The average cost booking could also be useful in other scenarios. For example,
       when you buy gift card in various discounted price, redeem it to an account, and
       use it later. One can manually recalculate cost-basis like this:

         2016-04-15 open Assets:CC
         2016-04-15 open Assets:ITUNES
         2016-04-15 open Expenses:Movie

         2016-04-15 * "15% off giftcard"
             Assets:CC        -85 USD
             Assets:ITUNES    100 GUSD {2016-04-15, 0.85 USD}

         2016-04-16 * "no discount"
             Assets:CC        -50 USD
             Assets:ITUNES     50 GUSD {2016-04-16, 1 USD}

         2016-04-16 * "recalculate cost basis"
             Assets:ITUNES    -50 GUSD {2016-04-16, 1 USD} @1 USD
             Assets:ITUNES   -100 GUSD {2016-04-15, 0.85 USD} @0.85 USD
             Assets:ITUNES    150 GUSD {2016-04-16, 0.90 USD}

         2016-04-16 * "rent a movie"
             Assets:ITUNES    -10 GUSD {2016-04-16, 0.90 USD}
             Expenses:Movie    10 GUSD {2016-04-16, 0.90 USD}

       (http://pastie.org/private/fxtirb6nhojyqmhuop9dfq) but it would be good
       to have beancount handle it for me.

       This is exactly what I do as well, and had similarly thought it would be a great
       secondary use for average cost booking. It would be good to document this
       somewhere. Perhaps Martin would like it in one of his documents or at Simon's
       plain text accounting site/"

    When I write the document on average cost basis, I'll add this example in.

** Auto-Generated Doc

  - Integrate submitted work on auto-generating Beancount docs in the Beancount
    source code itself.

  - Create a registry of all metadata fields being used in the system, with
    documentation for each, so that it does not end up becoming a mess.

  - Create a registry of valid experiment flags. These should be documented in a
    single place as well. This is all easy. How to list the available ones
    (bean-doctor should be able to do this from the registry).


** Presentation

  I'd should build another couple of presentations on Beancount. I'm thinking of
  making a few videos this time around, something that would be situational and
  educational.

  - Use impress.js to built a visualization of the DE method

  - Use photos of white board instead of Slides, use post its, maybe a chalk
    board. Do something original.

  - Record a video, that's an easy way to explain how this works.

  - IDEA!!!  Use drawings a-la-ThinkBig or whatever it is. This will be the
    perfect medium for this. Mix it with video. Start writing a detailed script.

  - Script 1: Begin with a USB key in hand. "On this 8 GB USB key, I have all of
    8 years history of financial transactions in my life. Every single price
    paid that went recorded into an account it these."

  - Script 2: Motivate by speaking of the results, ask "Wouldn't it be great if
    a single system could do all of that?" Explain that the task of inputting
    all the data in a single system is a lot less work than producing all the
    different reports IF you have a unified system. Beancount!

  - Slide: 4 methods: bean-web, bean-report, bean-query, write script + plugin

** Padding Documentation Review

  Some users have found themselves very confused about the intended usage of the
  Pad directive. Its documentation should be reviewed and improved
  substantially.

  - Put this in the docs to explain "pad"

** Google Docs

  - Write a script to download and bake all my PDFs docs in a
    mobile-friendly format.

  - I'd like the documentation links to open in "View" mode by default, YET
    still allowing the user to switch to "Suggestion" mode if they want to. See
    project volteface to complete this, this does not have to be a part of
    Beancount, this should be its own presentation project.

* Complete Display Precision Work

  Automatically determining the required number of fractional digits to render
  numbers with in reports can be surprisingly more complicated than it appears.
  Statistics on the numbers visible in the input file can be used to figure out
  good default values and options exist to override them. In addition, while
  some numbers should be rendered at their most common precision, other
  numbers--prices and rates--need to be rendered at a higher precision.
  Moreover, numbers rendered from an import tend to be produced with the minimal
  number of fractional digits but to render them nicely we should normalize that
  to the most common precision, while rendering more digits if they are present.

  For all the reasons above, at some point I built
  beancount.core.display_context, which provides an accumulator ("context") for
  statistics on precision and a formatter that can be passed around and used by
  the various rendering methods to produce sensible output.

  Tasks:

  - At the moment, the Formatter objects are defined to render a single
    precision for its numbers; this is problematic, because some of the
    to_string() routines of the core objects print out units, cost and price
    numbers at the same time. The Formattter object needs to be extended to
    support formatting all three.

    * Then, the core data structures should be reviewed for correct usage of
      this new, better formatter object.

  - When I implemented the display_context, I did not review the entire codebase
    for consistent usage. I'm a bit ashamed to admit that some of the code uses
    it, and some doesn't. It was a bit thorny to implement and after spending
    much time getting it to work right I did not finish converting all the
    existing code to it (I should have). In particular:

    * The reports code does not use it everywhere. Review all reports code for
      proper use of DisplayContext.

    * bean-web does not use it everywhere. Review all that code.

    * The rendering code used by bean-query has a DecimalRenderer object which
      uses its own method for determining the precision should clearly be
      converted to use the DisplayContext instead.

  - In beancount.ingest, in order to redner numbers pulled from imported data
    nicely for user review, I need to create a new rendering type of
    max(MAXIMUM, MOST_COMMON) for the DisplayFormatter. This type will always
    render at least the most common number of fractional digits but if required,
    render more fractional digits. I've found over time that this would be the
    most palatable rendering style to produce: learn the precision from the
    Beancount input file but render the full precision found in the imported
    files.

  - Make the printer support explicit tolerance syntax. This is crucial for
    round-trip.

  - Implement the maximum number of digits by accumulating the largest possible
    sum of all the ABSOLUTE values seen in the file. This should be a good basis
    for compute the maximum width possibly required to render with Align.RIGHT.
    There is currently a bug whereby that's not being computed correctly, the
    current algorithm is insufficient for accumulated balances, there is a
    bug.

  - Create a page in the web view that lists the various precision - by
    example - inferred in the global DisplayContext.

  - Make setting the precision from bean-example easier (provide a method to
    create that format and update without conversion on the DisplayContext
    itself).

  - In the DisplayContext, implement caching of the formatters created to
    increase speed, especially for printing a single entry repeatedly.

  - Implement reserved number of digits.

  - Add docstrings to DisplayContext.

  - In the EntryPrinter(), figure out the maximum width of accounts and set it up.
  - Add a "target num columns" instead of a "min_width_account" to the
    EntryPrinter and figure out the min_width_account automatically from it,
    depending on whether we've got render_weights on or not. Use the longest
    possible number of integral digits required from the DisplayContext in
    order to make this tight.

  - Add an option for the DisplayContext to issue a warning if numbers are
    rendered through it that lose some precision.

  - Add "display_precision" input file option whereby the user can set the
    precision to be used by each currency.

  - This needs to be handled properly, the last column needs to have correct
    precision rendering, using the DisplayContext:

      bean-query trans-pricing.beancount 'select account, sum(position),
      cost(sum(position)), convert(cost(sum(position)), "EUR") group by account'
              account                sum_position         cost_sum_posi convert_cost_sum_position_c_

  - bean-doctor context does not render all digits... it should render all the
    numbers as represented in memory. Don't round those numbers.

  - Review all the reports code and convert it all to render using the
    DisplayContext, make the query output also use it, and review rendering
    precision for cost & prices and maybe find a self-contained solution for
    passing two separate formatters somehow. {review-dcontext}

* Move Much of Core to Plugins

  Some of the functionality currently residing in the Beancount core could be
  moved to plugins. For example, processing directories for auto-creating
  document directives should not be part of the core (it's there for historical
  reasons: plugins did not exist at the time). I'd like to do that in order to
  simplify the Beancount core itself.

** Document Directives

  Document directives should be moved to their own plugin and numerous
  improvements can be carried out on them. Their association with transactions
  as well as avoiding collisions when creating them autoamtically would all be
  improvements to them.

  - Move the document option which seeks document files from directives to a
    plugin.

  - IDEA: Create a plugin that will convert "doc:" metadata to a document file,
    that will search for a unique string name in all the filenames and
    associate the filename with this directive via a link or something.

  - Write a proposal for implementing a transformation on a specific set of
    transactions, that supports capital gains with commission taken into
    account.

  - Can we automatically add a ^LINK to the document directive in order to
    associate a PDF with a document?!? -> For trade tickets. Maybe let the
    modules provide a import_link() function on the associated PDF files?
    (This is related to ^64647f10b2fd)

  - Document directives created automatically from directories of files should
    ignore documents already associated via an explicit documents directive;
    just ignore files with the same absolute name.

  - Documents found in parent directories don't end up creating a directive
    because we skip them because we only restrict to accounts which have had an
    open declaration... this is probably not what we want, in order to maximize
    the number of documents captured by this. {fa96aa05361d}

  - Idea: A link between a transaction to a document can be created by
    associating a document's checksum as the link of the transaction instead of
    a unique filename. If Beancount could associate them - and it could, it has
    access to the document files and the corpus of transactions - the web
    interface could insert a special link between the two. Maybe we could do the
    same thing with the filename as well.

  - A better idea to do this would be to allow specifying an explicit document
    directive, and finding document directives from files that are already
    specified should not re-create them. This way you can specify both the
    document and a transaction and use a common link as a natural way to
    associate them, e.g.:

       2014-06-20 document Income:US:Employer:GSU "2014-06-20.employer.0000000.pdf" ^ee63c6fc7aa6

       2014-06-20 * "PAYROLL" | "Refund for fractional shares" ^ee63c6fc7aa6
         ...
         ...

  - Document finding from files should not create documents that have been
    explicitly specified in the ledger. Avoid duplication! This is an important
    fix to make, that will allow both to co-exist together.

  - Make document directive accept links, so that explicit documents could be
    associated with specific transactions.

  - Generalize the scope of Document directives so that they don't just point to
    filenames, but can hold references to arbitrary document ids.
    * Rename the field from 'filename' to 'document'
    * Make the verification of that field against a filename option, enabled by
      a plugin.
    * Notify bw3443 about this.

  - Do we need a dedicated web page for listing all documents? This page could
    include documents without a date, could be rendered as a tree-table, with
    the list of each document in the corresponding account. Maybe that's
    overkill. DK.

*** Old Notes

  - You could define some special tags, like 'document', which could
    automatically try to find the corresponding document in the repository and
    insert a link to it in the web page. I already have a managed stash of
    document filenames... something like this:

      2014-05-20 * "Invoice from Autodesk"
        #document: 2014-05-20.autodesk.invoice200.pdf
        Income:US:Autodesk  -3475.20 USD
        Assets:US:Checking

    A document filename that does not get resolved could spit out a warning in
    order to keep the file tidy. This is a nice idea... perhaps nicer than just
    insert entries for documents, an actual link. Not sure if it would make that
    much of a difference though. Something to ponder.

    Create a plugin that will convert "doc:" metadata to a document file, that
    will search for a unique string name in all the filenames and associate the
    filename with this directive via a link or something.

** Balance Directives

  - Balance checks could also be a plugin.

** Open/Close Directives

  - I think if you relax the assumptions about having Open and Close directives
    for all accounts, those could even be moved to a plugin. Without this
    'open_close' plugin, accounts would just get auto-created and no error
    output if they weren't. With the plugin, we would have current strict
    behavior. This means that non-plugin code that requires the full set of
    accounts from a list of entries would not be able to rely anymore on the
    presence of open entries, and so would the validation.

** Pad Directives

  - Put all the Pad code into a single file as a plugin, same with Open Close,
    and Balance. Maybe we can organize those codes to be all localized in single
    files, and for many of these features, they can be implemented in
    self-contained plugins with all their codes together! openclose.py, pad.py,
    balance.py, etc. I think even 'event' directives can become those. And maybe
    a good way to disambiguate between ops adn plugins is just this... maybe ops
    is non-plugins, e.g. prices, summarize, etc.

  - Pad could be a plugin, definitely.

  - You could make the narrations for padding and summarization transactions
    specifiable via options.

** Dynamic Directives / Configurable

  - (old notes) I recently teased out that many of the basic functions can be
    implemented as individual stages of transformations on the list of
    directives. This started out as a way to add plugins by adding a custom
    transformation stage, but now I see that if I can make the parser able to
    consume generic syntax that might allow extensions, and to allow these
    plugins to specify new directive types for extensions, I might be able to
    shove a *lot* of the existing functionality into nice isolated plugin
    modules. Even functionality as basic as Balance checks. I'm not going to to
    do this in the first release, but I want to set the stage for it.

  - Make the plugins able to register types with the parser... this should
    allow the parser to call back on the plugins to create the appropriate
    types... this means true extensibility throughout! This is a fantastic
    idea... do this after v2 ship.  Maybe they get parsed as a special "Unknown"
    directive that accepts a grab-bag of strings and tags and accounts and
    amounts and they get replaced by the plugins; whatever Unknown trickles
    through would generate a warning in the errors.

  - It should be possible to make the parser accept unknown directives that
    accept an arbitrary list of accounts and string parameters, like this:

      2014-06-01 unknown Assets:US:CreditCard "Something"


* Import (Ingest)

  In Q1 2016, I converted the entire LedgerHub codebase to a leaner, simpler and
  better set of code under beancount.ingest. I finished all the work to convert
  what was previously there and while I'm quite happy with it, my original ideas
  for what the import code could do went a bit beyond what it currently does. It
  involves a number of small but impactful improvements, such as adding an
  on-disk cache so that repeating slow conversions (e.g., from PDF) would not
  have to be repeated, or to carry out some default cleanup up common input
  files. I also want to add a good CSV importer, and maybe a QIF one.

** CSV Importer

  - Separate the concern of the file format and table importers. This is a
    "table importer" which happens to have a CSV container. Similarly, XLSX
    containers are other table importers. Name things appropriately.

  - Create a good, default, useful, configurable importer for CSV files.

  - Write a CSV file sniffer that automatically infers which columns should
    match which fields. Try to make this smart, e.g., if some column "mostly"
    increases, it would be the balance column. This should be for fun (I don't
    need it).

  - Use new CSV downloads to build the importer; start using it.

  - The sniffer should support column types:

    * Date
    * Description
    * Change
    * Credit
    * Debit
    * Balance

    And should tolerance some cross-checking of the balance against the amounts.

** Solve Slowness Problems on Mac

  - Trying to bean-extract from LC on Mac takes FOREVER. Debug this thing
    damnit.

  - Implement on-disk cache now.

  - Implement logging of time take by each importer (verbose switch). In
    find_imports(). Do nice logging.

  - Fix ugly importer names from my configuration.
  - Uniformize all directory names from my configuration.

** Auto-Insert

  - AWESOME IDEA: Write a script that, given an input file with various sets of
    transactions, will find sections with most similar transactions in a
    destination file (the main file) and automatically insert those transactions
    in the destination file in the right place and run a diff with it. This
    should be part of the import suite. Do this as a post-process to import!
    Maybe use org-mode or other separators as a way to segregate groups of
    transactions.

** Regression Testing Improvements

  - Make example and real importers into properly named modules, not package
    __init__.py files and move tests to their own _test.py files, as per usual.

  - Improve the regression testing utility function: Allow the _test files to
    source outside of the same directory, but keep it easy to do so as well.
    Some people may want to share their importers yet test on real data too.
    This should be well supported. (For 'beansoup'.)

** Future Features

  - When multiple files match (as is the case for the A:CA:R importer) make
    file_one_file() put a copy of the file in each place instead of issuing an
    "Ambiguous accounts from many importers" warning.

  - Make beancount.ingest.importers.regexp.RegexpImporterMixin accept a
    "convert" optional argument that would be called by its get_text() method,
    and would allow us not to have to derive in order to support non-text files.

  - Implement formatting that's "minimum most-common" and use it on the
    importer's output, it would really improve the output of it, which is
    currently literal, e.g., it just prints what's from the file, at that
    precision. I hate correcting those manually.

  - In identify, mark as ambiguous if two handlers match.

  - Run directories check on each run of file? Disable with an option.

  - Make sure that when an exptest fails it includes the filename of the test
    somewhere in there; it's annoying when it's not present there.

  - Printing transactions should use the maximum precision between display
    context and natural. Create a new DisplayContext style, on top of "COMMON"
    and "MAXIMUM", call it something else, perhaps "COMPLETE". Should be max of
    context and natural.

  - Implement on-disk caching for conversions. This is important--it's quite
    frustrating to wait a few times too many. Do this now.

  - The code that auto-files statements needs to detect and de-dup files which
    have the same contents, because it is likely some files will be downloaded
    twice, it happens a lot.

  - When payee == narration, remove one of the two. This should be a generic and
    simple enough check to apply. This is a common occurrence.

  - There should be an automatic check that the accounts output by the
    extraction are all valid Beancount/Ledger account names.

  - Duplicate entries should cover all directive types (for balances).

  - Also, similarly, if one is entirely contained in the other, as happens often
    in OFX files, remove one. For example, here's what some OFX imports may
    look like with the current OFX importer:

       "DDA WITHDRAW MG21       MTL QC A / DDA WITHDRAW MG21       MTL QC ABM OPS MTL ABM O    MONTREAL      C AN"

  - Validation of directories (aka bean-doctor directories) should be
    automatically invoked by bean-file, and that would make sense.

  - Implement some hook to provide your own auto-categorization.
  - Provide some module that will attempt to categorize automatically, that can
    be inserted into this auto-categorization hook.

  - It would be super awesome if you could automate away the insertion of new
    transactions in the input file, following the previous transactions...
    we can find a heuristic to do this. That would be _really_ cool.

  - We will want to somehow "normalize" and merge payee names, because some of
    that differ very little are obvious for the same business... this would be
    useful. What kinds of tools will we need for that?

    Clean Import: The new importers should be able to strip the non-payee parts
    of the payee name, e.g. NEW YO, SAN FR, etc. Maybe we could let the user
    provide a filter function to sanitize the names of the payees, or maybe more
    generally just a filter on the entries before printing them out. This way
    you could provide your very own custom filter function that cleans up
    anything you don't like.

  - Importer should warn when not all the sections within have importers for it
    (R. OFX has many sections and one of the sections I needed - credit line -
    was missing in my importer config, so I discovered this). If we do this,
    this means that we may want to provide a "no-op" importer in order to
    silence that warning in case that's what's desired.

  - Write a generic import routine that will try to heuristically match
    partially completed transactions from an existing Ledger. Use some NLP or
    somesuch matching algorithm.

    Given some incomplete transactions, complete them heuristically based on
    previous contents of the ledger. This should make import a lot easier. This
    should be generic and work across all importers, a single function call.

  - Provide the previous ledger as input to extract(), some people may want to
    do per-account matching. See Filippo's request on this, whereby he wants to
    use the previous ledger's list of accounts to configure his importers. I
    suggested he load the previous file explicitly (taking advantage of the
    cache) in his configuration for now, but this is something I may want to
    revisit in the future.

  - In ingest, use /usr/bin/strings as a last resort if all other PDF converters
    fail.

  - When we import, if a file was not detected, don't spit out an org text
    line. Still doesn't work.

  - Deal with the problem of matching Google Wallet amounts directly... attempt
    to match a matching directive in the other account, and insert a link into
    the imported one.

  - Because one downloads all files manually, oftentimes the same file is
    downloaded twice. This should be detected and the duplicated identical file
    should be ignored entirely.

  - Transactions within the set of newly imported ones should never duplicate
    each other. Right now they do (see Transactions-Download-07-14-2016.csv).

  - It would be useful in many circumstances to rename the files but not to move
    them to their destination directory. For example, I'd rename the files and
    look at the filenames when processing PDFs manually to figure out what
    they're for.

  - A very interesting idea is for the CSV importers to cache already imported
    entries in a separate file, e.g., one signature for each row, and to use
    that to avoid double-importing. OTOH, it creates a potential problem whereby
    the result of an extraction is not stored in the Beancount input file and so
    further extractions ignore unseen transactions. An idea that is better than
    both of these would be to create a unique link made up of a short checksum
    for the import row and to cross-check this special link when considering the
    duplication, e.g. ^import-signature-c21c0fc8fe13 or something like that.
    That would work.

** GnuCash

  - Write a converter of GnuCash XML files into Beancount.

  - Contact xentac@ for an example GnuCash input file with 2-3 years of data.
    Willing to share (see email).


** Betterment

  - Process xentac's Betterment example PDF for the booking branch, that would
    be great input for a PDF converter, and figure out which lot identification
    method Betterment uses for tax-loss harvesting and rebalancing.


* Make Commodity Directives Required
{commodity-required}

  Zhuoyun Wei made a comment on a doc that account names are required to be
  declared by default while commodities don't. However, at this point they both
  have dedicated directives to declare them. Commodity directives are so far
  only used to hang metadata off of them. He suggests that Commodity directives
  should be required to be present by default. It would make the behavior
  similar as that of accounts. It would be more pedantic by default. Instead of
  a check_commodity plugin I could provide an auto_commodity plugin similar to
  auto_accounts, so you could use that in order to not bother. The stream of
  transactions would assured to always contain a Commodity directive if one
  appears, like for accounts.

  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/RHaV16bXlJs/Gyy5plujFgAJ

  - Do this.

  - OLD DESCRIPTION: options['commodities'] is currently where the list of all
    commodities seen from the parser lives. The
    beancount.core.getters.get_commodities_map() routine uses this to
    automatically generate a full list of directives. An alternative would be to
    implement a plugin that enforces the generation of these post-parsing so
    that they are always guaranteed to live within the flow of entries. This
    would allow us to keep all the data in that list of entries and to avoid
    depending on the options to store that output.

    This should probably be combined with a similar step that similarly
    enforces all unopened accounts to have an Open directive as well.

  - Make the onecommodity plugin skip accounts with multiple declared
    commodities. It should apply only to accounts which have no declared
    commodities. Then turn it on in my own file.


* Booking

  The 'booking' branch is one of the biggest branches ongoing in Beancount: it
  implements the proposal at http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-booking. It
  essentially consists in three big changes: (1) it allows a lot more
  opportunities for interpolating missing input, and (2) it changes in how lots
  are applied to inventories. Input specified in reducing lots will be
  interpreted as a partial match specification against the inventory of the
  corresponding accounts. This should allow users to provide the minimal amount
  of information and produce a specific lot. Augmenting lots always inherit the
  date of their transaction which will allow us to report on trades correctly,
  including automatically determining short vs. long-term holding periods, and
  finally (3) it introduces syntax to automatically merge lots together in order
  to deal with average cost booking. These changes will also allow aumatically
  resolution of ambiguous lots which will invoke a particular method chosen by
  the user, e.g. FIFO booking.

  In order to carry on during the tax season for TY2015, I implemented a kludge
  in the "carry_date_and_book_cost" branch. This will get removed.

  Tasks:

  - In the average cost method, add an option to determine whether explicit lot
    information should just be lost silently or if it should trigger an explicit
    error.

  - When lots are merged in AVERAGE booking, decide whether to keep the older or
    youngest lot using an option (add an option for this).

  - Make the "reduction_method" (rename from "booking_method") per-account and
    support the old method in the new code, as "FIFO". It really just is FIFO
    but now there will be lot splits instead of single lots being merged; this
    should work. Or you could call it "PRICEONLY".

    * Provide a global option "reduction_method" for its default value across
      all accounts. Set the default to "PRICEONLY" so that no changes occur by
      default.

    * Dispatch the new 'full' booking method to reduction_method "STRICT".

    * Support "NONE" and "AVCO" after that.

    * "AVDO" should be able to work even without the star marker.

  - Remove the horrible CARRY_DATE_AND_BOOK_COST kludge; do this by finishing
    the 'booking' branch and making the lots conform exactly to those present in
    the inventory balance, so that the inventory booking can proceed by
    comparing the entire cost object precisely...

  - Complete testing incomplete output with CostSpec:

    - This causes a problem because a tag is parsed in '#9.95':
      10 AAPL {45.23#9.95 USD}

    - Make sure parsing {3.00 # USD} does not produce the same CostSpec as {3.00 USD}.

    - Remove OLD comments from parser.py and update the description to use the
      xposition class.

  - Remove the beancount.ops.documents plugin, or perhaps make the loader
    operate in a raw mode, e.g. not running any plugins.

    egrep --include='*.py' -srn 'parse_(string|file)' /home/blais/p/beancount/src/python/beancount

  - Write test for beancount.parser.booking_full.

  - Merge beancount.core.interpolate into booking.
  - Merge beancount.ops.validation.validate_inventory_booking() into booking.

  - This causes a problem because a tag is parsed in '#9.95':
    10 AAPL {45.23#9.95 USD}

  - (Annoyance) Make interpolation.balance_incomplete_postings() return a new
    object and not work destructively. No reason not to.

  - (Annoyance) All functions that return an (entries, errors, options_map)
    triple really should return (entries, options_map, errors), in this order.

  - Improve the ability to detect a user-specific tolerance in
    is_tolerance_user_specified(). This heuristic is not great, find some better
    way.

  - Create a b.c.data.transactions_only() function to this common type of
    filtering and grep/replace everywhere. This is just too common not to create
    a utility.

  - Unref the constants in finalizer for module, here: {48414425cf78}.

  - Write a test to ensure that an auto-posting with no effect results in no
    new posting getting inserted.

  - Implement an optional feature that disables the merging of inventory lots
    for all lots except lots without cost. In other words, if there's a cost
    object, don't even compare them or try to merge them together; only lots
    without cost would automatically merge.

    I believe that this probably wouldn't cause any problems in selecting
    reducing lots and could simplify the "rules" for how inventory booking
    works. I'd want to test it out on my real file before committing to the
    idea. Removing merging of lots-at-cost would make the merging logic simpler
    and easier to understand.

    But what about something like this? Do we want multiple lots here?

       2005-12-29 * "Dividend on NB550"
         Assets:CA:RRSP:NB550            1.340 NB550 {18.2348 CAD}
         Assets:CA:RRSP:NB550           28.646 NB550 {18.2348 CAD}
         Income:CA:RRSP:Dividends

  - Test a conversion of shares with lot-date, e.g.:

      2000-01-18 * Buy CRA
        Assets:CA:RBC-Investing:Taxable-CAD:CRA           4 "CRA1" {232.00 USD / 2000-01-18}
        Assets:CA:RBC-Investing:Taxable-CAD               -1395.43 CAD @ 0.665027984206 USD  ; cost

      2000-02-22 * CRA Stock Split 2:1
        Assets:CA:RBC-Investing:Taxable-CAD:CRA          -4 "CRA1" {232.00 USD / 2000-01-18}
        Assets:CA:RBC-Investing:Taxable-CAD:CRA           8 CRA {116.00 USD / 2000-01-18}

  - Create a command in bean-doctor which lists all of the lots and their
    changes for a particular account. This is meant to be a debugging tool for
    booking algorithms. The rendering should be clear and detailed.

  - TEST CASE: When a label is provided on a lot, make sure that the label is
    unique throughout the entire file, not just on the inventory the lot is
    being inserted into.

  - Rename beancount.core.interpolate to beancount.core.tolerances

  - An important question: on an empty inventory, does the following transaction
    work?

      2016-04-23 * "Buy and sell on the same transaction"
        Assets:Investments:HOOL    1 HOOL {100.00 USD}
        Assets:Investments:HOOL   -1 HOOL {}

    One way to handle this would be to process all account augmentations before
    reductions. But that's not really possible, because the augmentation may
    require interpolation first. Hmmm. Difficult question. {f89b5b01e568}

    [This is being handled in the "booking" branch.]

  - Add an option "merge_lots" whose default value is TRUE, and which can be set
    to FALSE in order to avoid merging augmenting lots in the Inventory. It this
    is false, there's the possibillity of an inventory owning two lots which
    cannot be differentiated, and the only way for the user out of that
    situation would be to insert unique labels (indicate this somehow). Write
    unit tests for this. And try running it over my personal file to see if
    there's any instance of it ever happening (I don't think so).

  - Consider building a fromstring() constructor for Cost and CostSpec. This may
    make writing tests even easier and would complement what's there already.

  - Deal with all the FIXME cases in the new booking code.

  - Does the Inventory object require changes to make sure the dates are always
    set? Would that not make sense?

  - Write scripts to compare with the new and old method, on my own large file:

    1. Compare balances at random points in time (many of them)
    2. Compare transactions one-to-one.

  - There's a fair bit of sign change in the new booking code. Do test the case
    of negative inventories!

** Auto-Link Booking Transactions

  - Automatically create a link between transactions that book each other.
    I'm not sure how I'm going to implement that - perhaps in the lot matching,
    a hash to the original entry will be kept in the lot - but we should be
    able to update the links to all the transactions that book together.

    This will be a great debugging tool as well... a very powerful idea that
    can be implemented entirely in a plug-in.

** Original Idea for this Branch

  - Lot improvement: the lot specification on a reducing posting is only present
    to disambiguate which of the lots to reduce or match against. Maybe we
    should provide a different syntax when an expected reduction takes place,
    this would be allowed:

       (augment)
       2014-06-17 *
          Assets:US:Investing:HOOL    10 HOOL {523.45 USD / i-want-more}

       (reducing) All of the following should be allowed:
          Assets:US:Investing:HOOL    -7 HOOL ; possibly ambiguous
          Assets:US:Investing:HOOL    -7 HOOL [] ; possibly ambiguous
          Assets:US:Investing:HOOL    -7 HOOL [523.45 USD]
          Assets:US:Investing:HOOL    -7 HOOL [2014-06-17]
          Assets:US:Investing:HOOL    -7 HOOL [i-want-more]

    By enforcing a distinct syntax, the user is telling us that this leg is
    expected to reduce an existing position. This information is useful, in
    that it avoids possible mistakes. I like the explicitness of it.

    Sufficient debugging output should be provided from the "print" command to
    be able to identify which lot is being matched against and why. We need to
    provide more transparency into this.

  - FIFO or LIFO booking could be "enforced" simply by declaring the expected
    booking method of an account, and then issuing an error when explicit
    entries deviate from that method. This is an easy idea... would be very
    useful. The automatic method would only be used to resolve ambiguity! This
    is nice.

** Old Notes

  - Make a temporary hack to disable strict checks on a per-account basis. This
    will keep us going against average cost until the full inventory proposal
    is implemented.

      "The inventory booking proposal for average booking won't be implemented in
      the next few weeks... I'm tempted to think that maybe I should provide a way
      to disable the strict balance checks in the interim. This way we could enter
      the transactions without matching lots strictly... at least all the data
      would be present and the balance checks would work.  Would people think it's
      a good idea?  I would do this by extending the default value for the type of
      booking is intended to take place (as in the inventory proposal) and add a
      new value for it, i.e,. in addition to STRICT, FIFO, LIFO, AVERAGE,
      AVERAGE_ONLY, I would add NONE. I would use the proposed syntax extension for
      the Open directive, e.g.

      2014-08-84 open Assets:US:Vanguard:VIIPX    VIIPX    "NONE"

      This also means that you could setup all your accounts to remove all inventory
      booking, which results in a booking method similar to Ledger (no checks and no
      errors), by setting the default value for it, like this:

        option "booking_method" "NONE"

      This could appeal to those who would like less checks, like Ledger, or who are
      converting their Ledger ledgers to Beancount.

      Down the road, the inventory booking would use that and implement all methods,
      but for now, only the balance check would consult that value and disable the
      check if the default booking method is "NONE". I think I could easily hack that
      in a few hours."



  - Implement the proposal


  - (design) New inventory booking:
    1. for each posting, classify by currency
    2. for each posting at cost, classify whether position augmentation or reduction
    3. For position reductions, match against inventory
    4. Within currency groups, process interpolation, including those in
       position augmentations

    It should be possible to do something like this for cost basis adjustments:
       Assets:Account         -10 MSFT {34 USD}
       Assets:Account          10 MSFT {USD}
       Income:PnL             400 USD

    (See doc on Smarter Elision for a better version of this)



  - Separate inventory booking to be implemented in a plugin. It should do
    three things:

    * Find matching lots and raise errors when not found

    * replace all partially specified lots to their fully specified versions
      (they matched lots). For augmenting lots, this means insert the date. For
      lot reductions, it means, find the matching lot and use that instead of
      the partially specified one.

    * Insert links on matching lots, so that trades can be identified a
      posteriori.

    This means, move beancount.ops.validation.validate_inventory_booking() to
    its own file and make it do the three steps above.



  (avg cost idea)

  - Docs for inventory booking: Add {* 634.23 USD} idea for average cost
    booking: there should be an optional amount, and the star just means "before
    and after". Add this to B docs.

  - PROBLEM: You need be able to provide the cost with both and addition and a
    reduction, e.g.
       -2 HOOL {* 650 USD} ;; Should be possible even if current avg cost if 600 USD
        2 HOOL {* 650 USD} ;; Means "add at this cost and then convert to avg
    cost"

    This is nice! The "*" now always means "after applying this operation,
    convert to avg cost.".



  - You should add tests to ensure that an Inventory() can never have positions
    created with a cost of the same cost_currency as the currency. This should
    be enforced in the Position object itself.

  - After it's done, merge back branch 'sanscost', and we should be able to
    make this work using the total cost value on the lots.



  - Implement a report of Trades booked in the list of filtered transactions!
    Trades should be automatically identified by the booking process, with
    its own namespace of links. Then allow producing suitable reports for trades.

  - (reports) Bring back the trades report into the mainline version, using
    inventory reductions.

  - (reports) We really do need to report on position reduction as TRADES. This
    is an important report to generate! This should be done separately from the
    improved inventory booking method.

    This report needs to include the long-term vs. short-term nature of those
    trades! The right way to do this is to run a separate plug-in that will
    add appropriate #long-term and #short-term tags or meta-data to those
    transactions, based on their booking dates..


  - Add the acquisition date to each lot, so that short/long-term can be
    calculated for the lot. The goal is to enable the automatic calculation and
    reporting of long vs. short capital gains.

  - TODO: Conversion from CostSpec to Cost

  - Make interpolation work off of Cost instances, not just CostSpec.


  - Notes:

    varieties:

      1. No cost, no price, with currency, e.g.
           Assets:Something       213.45 USD
         or
           Assets:Something              USD
         This is obvious, it buckets into the units currency, i.e., USD.

      2. No cost, no price, no currency, e.g.
           Assets:Something
         This is an auto-posting. One of these should be replicated for every
         currency present in the transaction.


    Postings with a price define their currency:

      3. No cost with price:
           Assets:Something       1000 JPY @ 120.0000 USD
         or
           Assets:Something       1000 JPY @          USD
         We use the price currency, e.g. USD

      4. No cost and no price currency:
           Assets:Something       1000 JPY @
         In this case, we must consult the other postings. We look


    Then, we have postings with costs, which also come in two varieties:

      5. With an explicit cost currency, e.g.
           Assets:Something       100 HOOL {12.23 USD}
         Or with missing amounts, e.g.,
           Assets:Something       100 HOOL {USD}
         This clearly goes into the USD bucket.

      6. With no explicit cost currency, e.g.,
           Assets:Something       100 HOOL {2014-09-30}
           Assets:Something       100 HOOL {"1b24b1151261"}
           Assets:Something       100 HOOL {}
         These are uncategorized.

         In order to resolve these postings to a specific currency bucket, we
         implement two heuristics:

         a) If all the other legs are of a single currency and there are no
            other uncategorized legs, this posting must also book against those;
            use that currency.

         b) Otherwise, look at the accumulated ante-inventory; if there is a
            single currency for it, the posting must be in that currency.

         Finally, if we aren't able to resolve the currency of that posting
         using (a) or (b), fail interpolation/booking and skip the transaction.

    With that algorithm, we should be able to automatically resolve stock splits
    that look like this, as long as the ante-inventory contains only lots in
    USD:

      2015-09-30 * "Split"
        Assets:Investments:AAPL       -40 AAPL {}
        Assets:Investments:AAPL        80 AAPL {}

    Finally, note that postings with both a cost and a price must have a
    currency that matches, as constrained by the parser. If only the price or
    the cost is specified, we used that currency. Both a price and a cost may
    not be missing--that would leave two DOF to fill in.



** More Old Notes

  - IMPORTANT FEATURE: Implement Average Booking for 401k adjustments,
    with associated tests and syntax in the parser.

    Update for inventory.py:

      def average(self):
          """Merge all lots of the same currency together at their average cost.

          Returns:
            A new instance of Inventory, with all the positions of each currency
            merged together at cost, bringing all these positions at average cost.
          """
          logging.warn('FIXME: continue here, this will be needed to report positions')
          # FIXME: This is ill-defined, the grouping must also take into account the cost currency.

          units_map = defaultdict(Decimal)
          costs_map = defaultdict(Decimal)
          for position in self.positions:
              lot = position.lot

              cost_currency = lot.cost.currency if lot.cost else None
              key = (lot.currency, cost_currency)
              units_map[key] += position.number
              pcosts_map[key] += position.get_cost().number

          inventory = Inventory()
          for lotcost_currencies, units in units_map.items():
              lot_currency, cost_currency = lotcost_currencies
              cost_number = costs_map[lotcost_currencies]
              inventory.add(Amount(units, lot_currency),
                            Amount(cost_number, cost_currency),
                            allow_negative=True)

          return inventory


  - Change booking to always have lot-date and list trades automatically.
  - Report trades, all bookings should be findable after the fact using a link.
    This can be added without doing full booking.

** Link Trades

  - Create a plugin that will link together all reducing transactions
    automatically. When a transaction reduces a position, both transactions
    should have a common unique link. This should likely be done by default, by
    the new booking method, because it already requires for the matching to
    happen in order to book lots properly. This is an important new typ9e of
    report to support!


* Short Sales

  Test short sales in-depth. (They work now, but  I want more test cases.)

  - Allow short sales eventually. This should already work if all that you do is
    selectively suppress the validation check that verifies that a position at
    cost may not go negative. We could selectively suppress it by adding a flag
    to the open directive associated with an account, or maybe adding some
    special syntax in the cost specification that allows us to do this.

  - You can implement the sign check for positions held-at-cost only when there
    are other of that same commodity held at cost in the inventory in the
    opposite sign. This should allow holding short positions yet still retain
    the benefit of the check for data entry errors. It also removes what for
    most people will appear as a limitation from the docs (although with
    experience you would realize that it is not much of a limitation at atll).

  - Add tests for holding short positions.
  - Add tests for holding long and short positions in different commodities.

  - In order to relax the constraint that you may not add negative units at
    cost, we could only disallow under certain circumstances:

    * An account has received units in the opposite direction
    * If the posting cross the zero boundary. Maybe starting from zero in
      either direction could be fine.

  - Idea: Relax checks for negative values: from docs

      "PLEASE NOTE! In a future version of Beancount, we will relax this constraint
      somewhat. We will allow an account to hold a negative number of units of a
      commodity if and only if there are no other units of that commodity held in the
      account. Either that, or we will allow you to mark an account has having no
      such constraints at all."

* Cleanup, Deprecation, and Performance

  These are a number of pending tasks to tidy up the codebase in various ways.
  Some of these are more impactful than others.

** Core Cleanup

  - IMPORTANT: We need to test the return values of the Inventory.add_amount()
    method! Review and do this now.

  - Inventory: Implement a test for Inventory.get_amounts() with multiple lots of the same
    currency; they really should have been aggregated.

  - (Annoyance) All functions that return an (entries, errors, options_map)
    triple really should return (entries, options_map, errors), in this order.

  - Define a C extension module to implement D().
    This function should catch useless errors from the cdecimal library:
      Declined: [<class 'decimal.ConversionSyntax'>]
    and always provide the input string so we can debug WTF happened.

  - Reconcile all usage of account regexps to beancount.core.account.ACCOUNT_RE
    throughout the code  (grep --include='*.py'  -srn A-Z    ~/p/beancount/src/python/beancount).

  - An easy way to remove the diff_amount exceptional field from Balance is to
    move it to metadata, and this would be consistent with the goal of plugins
    using metadata for their own goals: assertions of Balance can be see as a
    feature of the plugins.

  - Rename test_util.TestCase.assertLines() to assertEqualNoWS().

  - Review all the source code to use data.filter_txns() everywhere we can. The
    data.filter_txns() function has been created but the code hasn't been
    converted.

  - Amount and Inventory and other basic classes: You could eventually support
    an implementation of __format__ which attempts to make sense of the
    different components, e.g., apply the format specifier to the number
    excluding the space required to render the currency.

  - (open directives) An invariant that we would love to have is to ensure that
    after parsing, all accounts that are used in a list of entries should have a
    corresponding Open directive for them. This would mean a variant of the
    validation routine that automatically inserts missing directives. At the
    moment, when an Open directive is missing, processing code that assumes they
    are always present might fail. We cannot insert the missing directives in
    the validation code simply because validation code is not allowed to modify
    the list of entries. We could insert a "fixup" step after validation, that
    does these kinds of automatic recoveries. Ponder this for a while.

  - (open directives) Do we need to insert Open entries for the equity accounts
    described in options? I think we could safely plop that at the very
    beginning of the entries list in the parser.

  - Document args of C functions in the same way as Python's, perhaps using the
    new Python3 syntax definition thingamajig (I forget the name, there's a PEP).

  - entries_table() really should be called postings_table().

  - Review all the code that is an effective switch/case on directive types and
    add checks for unknown directives. Make sure Commodity is being handled
    correctly. Grep for isinstance. Add else clause everywhere none was, e.g.
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/0e3be569f32a80411df8396d42d5e5ac3487a68f/src/python/beancount/core/realization.py?at=default#cl-292

  - Make _all_ plugins accept a configuration parameter, unconditionally. The
    interface should be this regular. Right now, some of the plugin functions
    accept configuration, some don't. This is easy and will make things more
    consistent.

** Realization Cleanup

  - You need to convert some of TestRealization to TestCheck.

** Install Cleanup

  - Don't install all the _test.py files, make sure they're not installed.

** More Testing

  - In the parser or in the validation, check that the price currency matches
    that of the cost currency, if both are specified!

       2011-01-25 * "Transfer of Assets, 3467.90 USD"
           * Assets:Investments:RothIRA:Vanguard:VTIVX  250.752 VTIVX {18.35 USD} @ 13.83 CAD
           * Assets:Investments:RothIRA:DodgeCox:DODGX  -30.892 DODGX {148.93 USD} @ 112.26 USD

  - Continue adding more of the pylint tests and make them pass. The codebase is
    almost at a point where it has all the tests from the default configuration.

  - Add a lint check that ensures the non-test files are never importing any of
    other test files.

  - You need to unit-test for multiline notes... do they work as expected?

  - Try to run the tests using 'watchr', 'sniffer', 'autonose' or other such tool.

  - Create special make target to run tests on my own large Ledger.
    This should bean-check, bean-roundtrip, bean-bake / scrape.

  - Implement a "fuzzing" input generator, that will output a very large input
    file with all possible kinds of combinations, to see where Beancount hits
    its limits and perhaps bring up some bugs from input I haven't thought of.
    This is easy and fruitful.

** Total Price Syntax Work

  - Document the @@ and {{}} syntaxes (see Matthew Harris email), especially as
    they relate to price.

  - You need to create a unit test for @@ price conversions.

  - As an aside, I see that the grammar supports @@ and {{}} syntaxes, but they
    don't appear to be documented in the language manual.

      Oh I hadn't noticed... I will document those, thank you for reporting this
      oversight.

  - When using @@ the signs should match; warn if they don't.

  - Make prices required to always be positive, including with @@, and err on
    negative amounts for prices. This will match Ledger semantics and will
    remove one degree of freedom that wasn't necessary.

** Parser Cleanup & Improvements

  - You need to validate the account name options (empty, or no :, use regex to
    constrain).

  - Make booking the cost on the same currency as the instrument impossible:

       <account>      1212.023 USD {100.00 USD}

    Ditto w/ the price. This should only be done after allowing zero cost.

  - Add support for triple-quoted strings, which may alleviate problems we're
    seen with syntax highlighting (idea from aumayr@).

  - What happens if you specify the same plugin twice, with different
    configuration strings?

  - KeyboardInterrupts (if you press it) in the parser will cause errors:

        $ bean-report $L exportpf > /tmp/export.ofx
        blais.beancount:42041: KeyboardInterrupt:

      This is exceedinly rare but maybe worthwhile to catch regardless.

  - It would be very useful to have #ifdef syntax support. See if this could be
    integrated with cpp by preprocessing the input. This would also take care of
    #include, potentially, and I might be able to remove that feature from
    Beancount itself. Just an idea.

  - (parser) Is it possible to specify no flag on a transaction?, e.g. just the date?

       2014-07-12
         ..

    Does this work? It would be nice if it did. Make it so. This is more
    permissive and would ease the burden of conversion for users already
    familiar with Ledger. We should change the grammar so that the flag is part
    of the txn_fields. This is elegant: basically, instead of the flag taking
    the place of the transaction, the 'txn' keyword just becomes optional.
    That's it. DO THIS!

  - Add an option to the parser to not just ignore unparsed lines, more strict.

  - BUG: A transaction like this fails to parse; allow it:
      2014-02-22 * "Payee" |
        ..

  - BUG: This input file without currencies does not currently fail! This is due
    to the parser accepting incomplete input. It should fail!

      2014-01-01 * "Buy Hooli"
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOL      120.00  {1212.5100 USD}
        Assets:US:Broker:Cash

      2014-04-08 * "HOOLI INC CL C SPINOFF   ON"
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOLA     -120.00  {1212.5100 USD}
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOLA      120.00  {1212.5100 * 0.4992 USD}
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOL       120.00  {1212.5100 * 0.5008 USD}

  - When an error occurs while parsing a directive/transaction, add the ability
    to let the parser skip until the next directive and ignore the parsed
    transaction because of the error. Maybe this should be an exception
    mechanism, or just storing a flag that gets reset when the directive is
    completed. Not sure. This would be a more elegant way to deal with some
    errors.

** File Cleanup

  - Remove plugins from ops, remove algorithms from core:

      (Also remove "documents" option and move that as input to this plugin.)
      b.ops.documents       -> b.plugins.documents  (not sure if breaks)

      b.core.getters        -> b.ops.getters (does it add deps?)
      b.core.realization    -> b.ops.realization (does it add deps?)

** Prices Cleanup

  - Make the code finding lists of commodities for holdings and price reports
    use the same code as beancount.ops.find_prices. Also, this should  really
    just be renamed beancount.prices.find_commodities and perhaps be moved up to
    beancount.ops.

      src/python/beancount/ops/holdings.py
      src/python/beancount/reports/price_reports.py

  - Remove the final traces of the "quote" metadata field from holdings:

      /home/blais/p/beancount/src/python/beancount/ops/holdings.py:153:      Commodity directive from its 'quote' metadata field.
      /home/blais/p/beancount/src/python/beancount/ops/holdings.py:190:            quote_currency = commodity_entry.meta.get('quote', None)

    Nothing else uses this anymore, this needs to go too.

  - Issue warnings when fetching prices with dates that are too far from the
    requested dates. We need to find a way to issue a global tolerance for this,
    that indicates to the user to fill in missing prices that are required to
    carry out particular reporting tasks.

  - Price entries should have extra metadata to disambiguate between implicitly
    created prices, linking to the original transaction that created them, and
    explicitly created ones.

** Example Files Cleanup

  - Convert example file to use beancount.plugins.ira_contribs plugin for mirror
    accounting.

** Revise Dependency Graph

  As I'm moving to a system with more plugins and less code in the core, and
  with the intermediate reports stage instead of just the web interface, it's
  becoming clearer where some files need to move.

  - Make various attempts to simplify depgraph, we want to ship with a really
    lean dependency graph.

  - ops & plugins should not depend on parser...

      * Move beancount.parser.options to beancount.core.options
      * Move beancount.parser.printer outside parser, ideally, or just factor the
        dependencies separately.

  - If you want to be consistent with the script names, rename
    beancount.reports to beancount.report. This way, bean-* matches a single
    package name. Just saying.

  - Emerge a principle for where the following files should separate, or merge
    the two modules:

      beancount.ops.*
      beancount.plugins.*

  - beancount.core.realization: Look at deps for beancount.core.realization and
    move it upstream where it makes sense, maybe ops.

  - beancount.core.getters: Should this move to ops as well? Check the
    dependency tree, see if it makes sense.


** Improve Balance Checks

  - An important option exists around the behavior of balance checks: Should
    balance checks bring their balance to the balance amount? In other words,
    should a balance check imply an automatic, on-demand Pad behavior on
    failure? This has an impact on following balance checks further in time. The
    current behavior is not to pad a failure, so if there are multiple balance
    checks, a single mistake before them would generate a number of errors. An
    equally valid behavior would be to trigger only a single error, isolating
    the periods between balance checks. Both semantics have advantages. You
    should provide an option to ustomize this behavior, the user should be able
    to choose. option "pad_failing_balances".

** Tagged Strings

  - Make tags and payees output "tagged strings", with their own data types. You
    can derive from str. These new objects should behave exactly like 'str' but
    carry over their type. This would be in force for tags, account names, and
    currencies.

    You need to write some careful testing to figure out what happens on
    concatenation, etc. with these types.

  - If you do this, you can make the Custom directive not output pairs of
    objects for its 'values' attribuet; instead, you'd use the data type of the
    str object itself.

** Improve Errors

  - Enhance error reporting! Make all errors possibly hold on to a list of
    entries, not just one. Many, many errors will benefit from this.

  - The creation of exceptions should be made easier: each error class should
    inherit from a base class that is able to accept an optional list of
    entries, that would automatically render the fileloc of each of those
    entries, and that would use the fileloc of the first entry in order to
    render the location of the error. If no entries are specified, an OPTIONAL
    fileloc= parameter should be provided to specify where the error occurs.
    This will make creating errors a lot easier and nicer.

    As part of this, we should also somehow produce a list of all possible
    errors with a lavish description.

  - Refine 'source' attribute on all directives: For .source, instead of '<...>'
    for the filename, we should use a scheme:..., like file://..., and
    plugin:beancount.... . This makes a lot more sense. The lineno still needs
    to be separate, we need that for sorting and prefer not to have it part of
    the string.

** Errors as Directives

  - (architecture) Seriously consider merging entries and errors; errors are
    just a special type of entry, and they have dates, and they get rendered in
    journals. This could make a lot of sense.

  - Interesting idea: Maybe instead of returning errors, "errors" could simply
    become "Error" directives and be inserted into the flow, and picked up by
    the various rendering routines in different ways?!?  I love this. One less
    thing to return. Hmmm ponder it seriously.

** Caching Improvements

  Caching is emerging as a key feature because adding more plugins increases
  processing time. I'd like to eventually be able to cache as much processed
  data as possible, per file.

  There are therre types of relevant caching:

  * Load cache: Caches the parsing and processing of a top-level Beancount file
    to a pickle.

  * Price cache: Caches previously fetched prices from external price sources.
    This allows us to re-run price fetching cheaply.

  * [Not Done] Document conversion cache: For importing new documents, some
    conversions are very expensive, in particular conversions from PDF. When
    there are problems, we end up having to re-run these slow conversions many
    times. Even without problems, we run them at least twice: Once for
    extraction and once for filing. We should build a conversion cache.

  These need to have consistent sets of related options and file locations.

  - Create a ~/.beancount-cache directory and store all the cache information in
    there instead of in the different places they are now.

  - I really need a --no-cache and --clear-cache options across all the
    programs, consistently defined. When developing a plugin, it would be so
    much more convenient.

  - Add options to disable the cache in bean-check so that using -v would be
    useful when you're trying to assess performance. I try this often enough I
    want options for it.

  - Use the same option on all tools for showing the timings, --verbose timings,
    maybe add it from the loader module.

  - (Performance) Great idea for performance: Implement the cache for each file
    separately. I could split my big file and only the bits which get edited
    would have to be recomputed.

  - All usage of environment variables should be removed by replacing them by
    the standard command-line options.

** Performance

  - (validation/performance) Optimize the performance of validations and bring
    all the HARDCORE_VALIDATIONS in by default.

  - Maybe the builder should have a 'filename' state that only gets changed here
    and there instead of getting that fileloc argument passed in every time on
    every rule. Maybe we just always get the fileloc from the parser.c as in
    NUMBER. I think it might make the parser more efficient too... try it out,
    do timings, see how much it improves parsing performance.

  - See if you replace BUILD()'s PyObject_CallMethod to this how much faster it
    gets: "Note that if you only pass PyObject * args, PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs() is a
    faster alternative."
    https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html

  - (performance) Profile the web pages, if account_link() is high, provide an
    explicit cache for each unique view. (We had to remove this when we
    simplified the function using build_url for adding tests.)

  - (performance) Implement the stable hashing function in C and reinstall the
    validate_hash test.

  - (performance) Implement inventories in C and reinstall the
    validate_check_balances test.

  - (performance) Don't pass in the FILE_LINE_ARGS on function calls, these
    should be part of the context of the parser, should be gettable only on
    demand.

  - Can I use Py_RETURN_NONE in order to incref and assign, in the lexer,
    instead of doing it in two steps?

  - Optimize the main update() routine that is called in display_context.

*** Parser Performance

  - Implement "D" in C, it's worth it. This should make a substantial difference.

  - Test using the empty case of list parsing to create the initial empty lists
    instead of the conditional in Parser.handle_list() and measure, to see if
    there is a significant difference in parsing performance.

  - Parser performance: try not calling back to builder for simple types that
    just return their value; measure the difference, it may be worth it, and we
    wouldn't lose much of flexibility, especially for the lexer types, which are
    aplenty.

  - Write the builder object in C... it won't change very much anymore, and
    that's probably simple enough.

  - Check the performance of D(). I suspect improving this routine
    could have a dramatic effect on performance.

* Python Types & Namedtuple
** Typed Data Types

  - Install proto3 and try to represent all the data using it; measure the
    difference in performance.

** Hashing

  - See if we can remove Position's __hash__ method now that it's a namedtuple.

  - Also, look at all the objects in b.core.data, and see if you can override
    the hash function on them automatically in order to ignore the entry in
    postings, and the listness in entry.postings. It would be nice to be able
    to hash every directive type.

* Portfolio Management

  I'm somewhat automating the process of managing my own portfolio using
  Beancount. I export the contents of my assets to Google Finance using a
  script, and I have a way to upload my current list of holdings to a Google
  Spreadsheet, though I haven't completely switched over to that. My plan is to
  ditch the GFinance export in favor of a custom spreadsheet, particularly
  because the latter can be entirely automated. My scripts will just update the
  list of assets in the spreadsheet and I should be able to derive various
  measures from that.

  - Complete the automation of uploading my portfolio to a spreadsheet and begin
    using that (over the Google Finance solution).

  - "Computing portfolio returns using Beancount." Create a new document to
    describe the process, to describe how to do that.

  - Make sure that the list of holdings computed by bean-query is the same as
    that generated by the holdings report... Would it be possible to compute the
    latter using the former?

  - You should be able to export to input files or APIs for websites that track
    portfolios for you, such as Google Finance and Yahoo and others. Use the
    list of holdings as input. This should perhaps just be another report name.

  - Move the current portfolio code hacks out of my private repo and make that
    into the main repo.

  - Possibly create a 'beancount.portfolio' package  and move all the there,
    validated and all, if there's enough meat for it.

  - In holdings: create the concept of a "composition" which can be associated
    to any holding, based on the (account, currency, cost-currency), and which
    is a vector of proportions to be normalized and associated to the holding.
    You should then be able to compute the sum total of all compositions. This
    can be achieved with metadata, and it could be a generalized concept, with
    the following applications:

    * Liquidity (how easy is it to get money out of this account?)
    * Taxability (pre-tax, roth, after-tax, usually 0 or 100%)
    * Sector, industry exposures
    * Currency exposure
    * ...

    Honestly, it would be even better if we don't have to even do that and if we
    can do this by querying metadata and aggregating on the postings directly.

  - Compute pre-tax and post-tax net worth reports, based on a "tax" account
    metadata field and some reasonable assumptions.

  - Fetch the CSV holdings of each Holding and compute the full list of stocks I
    own from these ETFs in dollar value. Sort by larger to smaller. Also compute
    the industry with that. You need to write Vanguard download (harder, need to
    scrape), and iShares download (easier, CSV).

  - Implement the dashboard on the example file, take the code out of my
    private code stash and share.

  - Replace the portfolio script by a bean-query command that will use metadata
    on the commodities (!). This will simplify things a lot and be more
    flexible. These are really just aggregations of a different kind.

** Dashboard

  Add the following to the portfolio dashboard:
  - PnL since yesterday, one week ago, two weeks ago, one month ago, three months ago
  - Current portfolio breakdowns
  - Cash report
  - A listing of short-term lots vs. long-term lots
  - Schedule of lots to become long-term in the near future
  - Returns (computed correctly, over many periods)

  From email to fxt:

    I want to build an investment dashboard, that would contain:

    - List of holdings, with various rollups (see the different aggregations of
      holdings reports)
    - Rollups of holdings against various types (e.g., Stocks vs. Bonds)
    - P/L since the morning or for the last day, over the last week, last two
      weeks, last month, last quarter, last year.
    - Report of uninvested cash and the detail of where it is
    - A listing of short-term vs. long-term lots, and a schedule of which lots are
      going to switch from short-term to long-term in the near future (to avoid
      selecting those for sale)
    - Returns, as computed by my prototype of our ideas during the bicycle trip
    - Automatically refresh current prices if run intra-day

    This script would run every hour on a crontab and generate static HTML files
    that I could access from my phone to make investment decisions and monitor
    gains/losses during the day. I'm certain you would appreciate having such a
    thing too. I want to integrate the code I already have out of
    beancount/experiments and start moving all this stuff to the
    beancount.dashboard.* and add unit tests and make it work on the tutorial file.
    This should make it easy for others to use.

* Removal of Holding Object

  At some point in Q4'2015 I overhauled the Posting object to rationalize its
  attributes. The result is a much simpler object, and one which could readily
  be used instead of the Holding objects I had defined in beancount.ops.holdings
  and beancount.reports.holdings_reports. I'd like to remove the Holding class
  to reduce complexity. This will make generating the reports for portfolios
  more straightforward: the list of assets simply should be the list of Postings
  accumulated at a particular point in time.

  - Remove Holding object everywhere and replace it by Posting. Convert all
    aggregation routines to work on Posting instances instead. {holding}

  - Replace Holding by the new, flattened Position, it's a _lot_ more like it.
    Makes a lot of sense now. Move the price_date to .meta, I don't think it's
    actually used.

  - In doing so, it might be useful to enrich the Price field of a Posting
    object with a date (number, currency, date). This would allow the creation
    of holdings at different dates. I'm not entirely certain we need it.

  - When attempting a conversion in holdings, if the rate isn't available
    directly, you should always attempt to value it indirectly via an
    indirection through one of the operating currencies.

  - Add the acquisition date of each lot to each Holding, and it should be
    output at that date by print_holdings as well.

** Old Notes

  - I think there's a way to simplify holdings: you can probably remove the
    "Holding" type and replace that with a Posting, which really, is much like a
    Holding, it has an account and a position, and a price.... That would
    normalize Holding quite a bit, even if it means we end up adding a few
    unused slots to Posting. I'm happy to do that! Simplify simplify simplify...
    always.

  - Along with the new inventory, you can make Holding -> Position. This makes
    a lot of sense actually. Do do this!

  (work on holdings)
  - Support output format "beancount" for holdings, use a single file instead of
    a holdings I/O file (merge holdings.csv + prices.beancount -> holdings.beancount)
    This would be much nicer.

  - Check holdings I/O by saving and reloading a list of holdings created from
    a set of entries (with sales, just to make sure).

  - In add_unrealized_gains(), convert to use our holdings aggregator.

  - Build a new category to portfolio to identify accountings holding
    "Uninvested Cash", which should be cash available to invest now.



* Computing Asset Returns

  Another important task I've been trying to do is to process my investment
  history in order to compute the actual, precise returns, including all fees
  and taking into actual my particular cash transfers. Most brokers will provide
  either the generic returns of a particular instrument regardless of your
  exposure over time, or the difference between the current time and some past
  time for your entire portfolio. Neither of these is sufficient to evaluate
  your portfolio returns. I want to compute the returns of each instrument
  separately, entirely from the Beancount input file, and then combining those
  returns histories to compute portfolio returns.

  In order to do this right, the structure of each investment has to follow some
  sort of pattern so that for each instrument we can identify external flows of
  money, internal flows, and "value accounts" which contain the commodities
  whose price fluctuates. I had a pretty good shot at this in the 'returns'
  branch, which has been merged, and have found some shortcomings, so I wrote
  the 'returns2' branch, but it is yet incomplete and I have to restart working
  on this at some point.

  - I need to add detailed debugging information in order to troubleshoot the
    cases where it does not work well. There are several corner cases and I've
    been having a difficult time identifying exactly why it fails for some
    commodities. Time to write some nice debugging output, this will be useful
    later, and for others, and for others to share when asking questions if they
    face similar difficulties.

  - In order to compute this properly, I will need to pull prices at various
    points in time. I want to automate the process of figuring out the dates at
    which prices are needed, i.e., when the prices in Beancount at too far from
    the evaluation dates, and perhaps automate the fetching of all necessary prices.

  - Bring in all the generic functions from experiments/returns/returns.py into
    core beancount. Bring in returns as a plugin.

  - Prices: Write a script to output the timeline of prices/rates missing &
    required in order to compute all the returns correctly. Then use it to drive
    fetching a historical table of monthly or perhaps weekly exchange rates for
    USD/CAD, USD/AUD, EUR/USD since the beginning of my file. Make this script
    reusable.

  - Fetch missing prices for my input file and recompute returns.

  - Returns calculation should spit out missing prices.
    Automate returns calculation.

  - Fix FIXME in beancount.projects.returns, from DClemente issues.

* Net Worth

  A complement to the portfolio management features is the ability to report on
  the total "net worth" on the balance sheet, over time, and as pre- and post-
  tax amounts.

  - Make the net-worth-over-time script output post-tax networth as well, using
    metadata. In other words, the post-tax amount should represent the
    liquidation value of the portfolio if all tax liabilities had to be incurred
    (e.g., taking all the money out of tax-deferred retirement accounts). This
    should use a percentage meta-data field in order to figure out the
    approximate taxation rate, e.g.,

       2014-01-29 open Assets:US:Vanguard:PreTax401k
         tax: "pre"

    Allowable values should be:

      "pre"   : For regular tax-deferred accounts, where the entire amount is
                taxed on distribution.
      "after" : For after-tax 401k accounts where only the gains are taxed on
                distribution.
      "roth"  : For Roth accounts (not taxable on distribution).
      None    : For taxable accounts.

  - Make the net-worth script into an official project, don't just leave it
    under experiments. Do this only _after_ the removal of the Holding object,
    to minimize changes.

* Standalone Tools

  In order to produce many of the reports, I've had many ideas of composable
  command-line tools to build and provide for processing text with account
  names. These are small standalone projects.

  - Build a function and command-line tool that can injest either a table of
    results or a CSV file and infer that an entire column is of numbers and
    pairs of numbers and can accordingly split the column into multiple columns
    and put the currency in the header so you can import that up to a
    spreadsheet.

  - Build an 'statement' tool that will render a treeified balance sheet in two
    columns! Limit it to use the beginning of a line, and hard-code to use the
    five known categories (optionally changeable). It's okay if the tool is a
    bit more limited than treeify. It should optionally do the treeification.
    It should also optionally sort the account names (or not).

    * Add a --title option to render at the top.

    (A two-column tool to convert one column into two columns (for text mode
    balance sheet and income statement). The equivalent UNIX tool does not
    exist. Select columns by regexp on prefix.

  - Build a simple 'colrneg' tool that just highlights numbers as green or red
    depending on if positive or negative.

  - Perhaps should build a version of treeify for internal usage that works on
    HTML columns, off of HTML text. Or BETTER: just a stateful tool that can
    transform an account's name to indent it properly every time you feed it the
    full account name! This could be used by the routine that want to render
    columns as tree. Maybe 'treeify' should use that as well. That would make a
    lot of sense.


* Streamline Commands

  As features grow, so do commands. I'd like to minimize the number of them,
  where it makes sense. I find it's often possible to do that.

  - I plan to remove bean-example and fold that into a bean-doctor subcommand.

  - Maybe bean-bake could be folded into bean-web.

  - bean-sql is a bit of an experiment, I'm not sure we need it, but I want to
    keep the functionality. Maybe this should only be a subcommand of the code
    that provides Beancount postings as a a virtual SQLite3 table.



* Debits & Credits Normalization

  One simple idea that might make at least some people happy is to make it
  possible to input the great majority of numbers as positive numbers. This
  can easily be done by considering the account type to which a number is
  attached and invert the number, if necessary. For example, if this input mode
  is enabled, you would input a posting to Income as a positive number, but it
  would be interpreted as a negative number.

  - Allow sign normalization:

    * Add an option to the parser to allow signs to be entered with the "all
      positive" convention, and actually invert the signs right at the output
      of the parser.  Balance errors should be enhanced to emphasize which of
      the postings should be increased or decreased, based on the sign of the
      balance error and the type of each account.

    * For display, in the shell, provide a SIGN(account) function that allows
      the user to multiply the inventory by, or a NORM(inventory, account)
      function that would do that itself on the inventory.

    This whole thing should be a minor version. This would be a valuable feature
    IMO, allowing users to choose their favorite convention would be a plus.

  - Do support rendering options to invert the amounts of the minus accounts.
    This is an important feature.

  - The new balance sheets should be able to invert the numbers (and then they
    should get rendered differently). Basically, every number shown should be
    either in signed or cr/dr format. We should be able to switch between the
    two at render time. This should work across all number-rendering routines
    everywhere--do this centrally.

  - In the balance sheet and income statement, we need to render the amounts
    inverted (and in a slightly different style).


* Sanity Check For Conversions

  - Insert a validation check when transferring amounts to the balance sheet
    that the implied rate of the conversion entries is within certain bounds of
    the price, for each pair of commodities (find a way). These bounds should be
    proportional to the variance of the price. This would just provide an extra
    amount of good fuzzy feeling, knowing for sure that my solution to the
    conversions problem is always meaningful and correct.

* Add an "End Balance" Directive

  Some people are requesting and end balance directive.

  - Create one by fudging the date and storing a regular Balance directive. This
    is an easy task.
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/118/create-a-balance_end-directive


* Improve the Include Directive

  - Support an include directive that is a URL, in order to fetch lists of
    prices updated remotely, or via crontab. This way the dashboard does not
    have to include code that fetches prices.

  - Idea: an include directive should have a "prefix" option, to add a prefix to
    all accounts from the included file.


* Improvements to Price Fetching

  - Infer the rendering precision for inverted currencies from only the list of
    previous prices. Run a DisplayContext on those and do similar
    quantization/rounding automatically. This would make a lot of sense,
    especially when inversion generates a very large number of digits.

  - Write a script that will iterate and fetch all the missing dates on Friday,
    or last DOM for the required portfolio during the entire duration, or allow
    providing a frequency string (does rrule have one?) and let bean-price do
    this natively. This will work the API.

  - You have to deal with the case whereby two currencies provide incompatible
    conversions of each other. This would potentially result in colliding
    entries in the price database. Not sure how to deal with those yet.

  - Write a script that will automatically fetch the dates I held various
    positions at cost for throughout the history and a list of weekly dates to
    fetch rates for.

** OANDA

  - Finish the implementation of my delayed rate fetcher from OANDA.


* Will & Legacy

  One of the tasks I'd like to Beancount to be able to do is to produce
  documents which list the account details of assets and liabilities, including
  account number, institutino address, phone numbers, contact persons, etc. in
  order to encrypt and share with a trusted one, in case I pass away.

  - Create a new type of report that produces a readable document with the
    entire list of accounts and descriptions and account numbers pulled from
    metadata. This document should be attacheable to a will, to describe all the
    accounts, institutions' phone numbers, account numbers, in a way that makes
    it possible for someone executing a will to easily understand that full
    nature of the assets and how to reach the relevant institutions to liquidate
    the assets.

  - In order to have someone else be able to take care of your business, you
    should be able to produce a list of the accounts open at the end of the
    period, with the account ids and balances. This should be printable and
    storable, for someone else to take care of your things in case you die.

* Gains Sans Commissions

  How do I take into account the commissions and fees adjustment on the cost
  basis for a position? You need to be able to accommodate commissions as not
  being part of the gain.

  BRANCH: 'sanscost'

  - This work depends on the completion of the 'booking' branch.

  - Capital gains should not count commissions nor on the buy nor on the
    sell side. How do we book them like this?  Can we count this somehow
    automatically? Misc accounts? Not sure.

* Normalized Credit & Debits

  One idea is to allow the user to work in terms of credits and debits, using
  all (largely) positive signs for all postings.

  - Make this possible in the input, switch the signs in the parser.

  - Also render the numbers with normalized, positive signs only.

  - Make it possible to render the credits and debit numbers separately, putting
    them in the correct column based on their account type AND sign.

  - Rendering only: Color the background of numbers with an inverted sign (e.g.
    payments in a liability account) differently! There should be modes to
    rendering balance sheets and income statements with inverted amounts, and it
    should all be done client-side. When amounts are rendered as credits/debits,
    color their background distinctly, so that it's obvious what kind of sign
    convention is in use.

* Total Balance

  Currently, the Balance directive only asserts the currency of its attached
  amount. Some users have requested a balance check that is exhaustive, that is,
  which asserts that the inventory matches the contents of a directive.

  - Implement some parser-level, generic directive for specifying the contents
    of an inventory (units only).

  - Implement a total balance assertion using the following syntax:

      YYYY-MM-DD balance
         account    amount
         account    amount
         account    amount
         account    amount

    The distinction is that it's on multiple lines. Maybe call it balance*.

  - A variant on this would be a balance directive which asserts the cost basis
    of an account, either by currency, or total. Perhaps this could be useful,
    and if anything, easy to implement. See past discussion with Eric Weigle on
    the ledger-cli mailing-list.

  - When you will add cost basis to the balance assertions, make the padding
    directive also able to fill in with some cost basis. This would be useful
    for mharris (see discussion on Language Syntax document).

  - Create a new directive for balance that checks for the complete balance.
    Ideas for syntax:

      2014-06-20 balance      Assets:Some:Account    10 HOOL, 640.40 USD   FULL
      2014-06-20 balance      Assets:Some:Account    [10 HOOL, 640.40 USD]
      2014-06-20 balance      Assets:Some:Account    <10 HOOL, 640.40 USD>
      2014-06-20 balance*     Assets:Some:Account    10 HOOL, 640.40 USD
      2014-06-20 full_balance Assets:Some:Account    10 HOOL, 640.40 USD

    Maybe we should define a general syntax for input'ing an Inventory object,
    that could be read at parsing time.

* Wash Sales

  Right now [2016-04-20], there is an experimental plugin that's there to
  remove the commissions from the P/L (experiemnts/washsales/commissions.py).
  This is then used by two custom scripts
  (experiemnts/washsales/list-wash-sales.py) which uses metadata from the
  postings marked to be washed by the user, and all the "washing" takes place
  somewhere in that script, not in Beancount. There is also another script
  (experiemnts/washsales/list-lots.py) which is used to list the resulting
  lots.

  - Document all cases of wash sales and support arbitrary washing of sales in
    an official Beancount plugin.

  - You need to make the washing of the lots a part of regular Beancount, the
    washing of the lots needs to occur within Beancount, not in
    the list-wash-sales.

    For example, this transaction:

      2015-05-19 * "Sold some" ^c2fbec103d99
        ref: 036
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOL                       -X HOOL {538.6500 USD} @ 552.4460 USD
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOL                       -X HOOL {577.5400 USD} @ 552.4460 USD
          wash: TRUE
        Expenses:Financial:Commissions           0.19 USD
        Assets:US:Broker:Cash                   XXXX.XX USD
        Income:US:Broker:HOOL:PnL

    Should be converted to this one automatically:

      2015-05-19 * "Sold some" ^c2fbec103d99
        ref: 036
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOL                       -X HOOL {538.6500 USD} @ 552.4460 USD
        Assets:US:Broker:HOOL                       -X HOOL {577.5400 USD} @ 552.4460 USD
          wash: TRUE
        Expenses:Financial:Commissions           0.19 USD
        Assets:US:Broker:Cash                   XXXX.XX USD
        Income:US:Broker:HOOL:PnL
        Income:US:Broker:HOOL:PnL              YYY.YY USD
        Income:US:Broker:HOOL:Adjustments     -YYY.YY USD

    The list-wash-sales script ought to be a simple gathering of the already
    washed sales.

  - Listing the lots in a particular account at a particular date should be
    carried out not with a custom experiments/washsales/list-lots.py script, but
    rather by writing a simple SQL query. This requires the 'booking' branch to
    be completed, and the CSV output from bean-query to work as well. Do this.

  - Enumerate the various cases for wash sales, write a nice document for them,
    and write example cases for each, to be referenced from the document. Solve
    this completely, using metadata and a plugin.


  I wrote a script to wash losses for entire lots. This still needs more work:
  ideally, one should be able to insert an arbitrary cost basis adjustment for
  each lot. Do this, and integrate with the wash-sales-tracker implemented by
  bbreslauer.

  - It should be possible to produce input for the wash sales calculation, to
    then insert metadata or some other set of postings on each lot, and to
    produce output suitable to be printed and sent to the IRS.

  - There is already a plugin which allows the user to wash away the P/L of
    entire lots under experiments/washsales. Enhance that to support arbitrary
    adjustments and move that into 'beancount.plugins'.

* Stock Splits

  Beancount currently does not deal with stock splits, but you can deal with it
  yourself. Essentially, you have to write a single transaction which empties
  out your positions and recreates them at their new cost basis. You process
  could be automated, probably the best way to carry this out would be to write
  a plugin that provides a new custom directive.

  - Find a way to automatically create multiple currencies to account for stock
    splits. The user should not have to do this themselves:

      "One choice you have is whether you want to keep the same symbol pre and post
      split. If you keep the same symbol the price database will show a drop in
      price over time. If not, choose a new symbol for the post split period. So far
      in my own file I use the same symbol but I think eventually I'd like to find a
      way to differentiate them automatically and have a multiplier in the price
      database, because doing it manually is not nice. In any case both methods
      work."

    Perhaps a directive could be created to declare them that would
    automatically insert converting transactions, but that makes it difficult to
    deal with weird cases, like oddly unequal splits (e.g. Google A/C), or cases
    with spinoffs, as below. Perhaps the splitting transaction should be
    inserted automatically, but that the split directive would just create a new
    currency name, internally.

    A currency would then be referred to by a pair of (name, date), and that
    would resolve to a internal currency name.

  - (IDEA) In order to create suitable stock split entries that would look like
    this:

      2013-04-01 * "split 4:1"
        Assets:CA:ITrade:AAPL             -40 AAPL {{5483.09 USD}}
        Assets:CA:ITrade:AAPL             160 AAPL {{5483.09 USD}}

    You could easily add support for a directive that looks like this:

      2013-04-01 split Assets:CA:ITrade:AAPL  4:1  AAPL

    This would allow the user to do some processing specific to stock splits by
    processing the explicit stock split entries.

  - Include this in the user examples, + stock splits:

       2013-04-01 * "name change"

         Assets:CA:ITrade:AAPL             -40 AAPL {{5483.09 USD}}
         Assets:CA:ITrade:NEWAAPL             40 NEWAAPL {{5483.09 USD}}

       2013-04-01 * "spinoff"
         Assets:CA:ITrade:KRFT             -100 KRFT {{20000 USD}}
         Assets:CA:ITrade:KRFT              100 KRFT {{17000 USD}}
         Assets:CA:ITrade:FOO                20 FOO  {{ 3000 USD}}

  - Because of the way we currently deal with stock splits, allow a list of
    commodity names on the commodity directive, so you can do this:

      1998-01-01 commodity CRA,CRA1
        name: "Celera Corporation"
        asset-class: "Stock"
        ticker: "CRA"
        quote: USD

* Sharing Expenses
** Producing Journals as Tables

  - Figure out some way to report the names of the other accounts of a
    particular account. For example, render a journal as a detailed expense
    report, for a set of accounts (e.g., Expenses:*) pulling out amounts in
    various columns based on other expressions (e.g. Assets:Cash:Caroline).

    This would be an approximation:

      bean-query $L "
        SELECT date, account, maxwidth(description, 25), convert(position, 'USD')
        FROM has_account('Caroline')
        WHERE (NOT account ~ 'Caroline')
          AND (NOT account ~ 'Rounding')
          AND account ~ 'Expenses:';"

      However it doesn't work so well. The description isn't good enough.
      A better approach would be to just provide a special which lists all the
      other accounts in a single string.

* Book Unrealized Gains Correctly

  - IMPORTANT: Unrealized gains for opened periods should show only gains since
    the openings. In other words, unrealized gains should be realized
    marked-to-market at the time of open.

  - Unrealized gain when rendering for closed years does not appear.
    Perhaps we should insert the unrealized gains during close operation.

    Idea: close realized gains along with close(), so that they don't show up for
    the latest year.

  - Unrealized gains should be modified so that they replace the book value of
    the positions that they adjust, and can be applied at multiple dates. Then,
    the realization should automatically occur both at the beginning and end of
    reporting periods.

** Old Notes

  - Unrealized gains should not be added if the gain is zero.

  - There's a fundamental question about which date to be used for pricing
    entries. This really would depend on the view. If this is a period view, the
    date of the last entry is most appropriate. If it is any other kind of view,
    the latest price is best. All the reports should be adjusted for this.

** Old Notes

  - Unrealized capital gains could be inserted automatically into special
    sub-accounts, based on the current price and the cost-basis of particular
    accounts. This could be inserted automatically! e.g.

        DATE check Assets:US:Ameritrade:AAPL       10 AAPL {200 USD}

        DATE price AAPL  210 USD

      Assets:US:Ameritrade:AAPL                    2000 USD
      Assets:US:Ameritrade:AAPL:Gains               100 USD

    The "Gains" subaccount could be inserted automatically if the price differs
    from the cost basis... this would be a clever way to represent this! We
    could even do this by inserting a transaction automatically with an
    offsetting account... actually this would be the RIGHT way to do this!

      We need an option to designate which subaccount leaf to create all
      the new transactions for:

        %option account_unrealized  "Unrealized"

        2013-05-23 'A "Booking unrealized gains for AAPL"
          Assets:US:Ameritrade:AAPL:Unrealized              230.45 USD
          Income:Unrealized                                -230.45 USD

      By doing this, the reporting does not have anything to do... it can choose
      to report positions at cost or in held units, and whether the gains are
      included or not entirely depends on whether these transactions have been
      inserted in or not.


* Pivot Reports

  An interesting reporting idea which comes back again and again is the ability
  to produce a year-on-year or month-by-month summary of income and expenses, as
  a table. This is essentially a pivot table where the date (year or month) is
  rendered as the X axis, and accounts used on the X axis. Account balances are
  aggregated in the cells.

  - Implement PIVOT reports directly from the shell. These are oft-requested.

  - Including RSP contribs, like my big spreadsheet that I crafted manually? Can
    I do that? That would be awesome!

  - 'csv-pivot': build this: a script that can accept a CSV file and render a
    CSV pivot table from it. The reason we need support is in order to carry out
    operations on columns of inventories. Maybe we should impleemnted some sort
    of swiss-knife tool that is able to parse inventories from columns and
    perform various operations on them, aggregations, etc. using Beancount's
    Inventory() class. This could be a powerful tool! Make it possible to parse
    and create Inventory objects from cells.

  - One kind of report that would be GREAT is a single grid with all income accounts
    on the left with year by year on the horizontal. An overview of all the
    years. Same with month-by-month report.

** Use Metadata for Pivoting

  - One idea Ledger uses well is the ability to associate key-values meta-data
    to transaction objects, a-la-Common Lisp. See the --pivot feature. It seems
    a bit superfluous at the moment, but may be useful in order to provide the
    ability to implement custom aggregations eventually, instead of using the
    strings. Maybe the payee could be a special case of this, e.g payee="value"

    (From mailing-list):

      Take this example:

      2011-01-01 * Opening balance
          Assets:Cash                               25.00 GBP
          Equity:Opening balance                   -25.00 GBP

      2011-02-01 * Sell to customer AAA
          ; Customer: AAA
          ; Invoice: 101
          Assets:Receivables                        10.00 GBP
          Income:Sale                              -10.00 GBP

      2011-02-02 * Sell to customer BBB
          ; Customer: BBB
          ; Invoice: 102
          Assets:Receivables                        11.00 GBP
          Income:Sale                              -11.00 GBP

      2011-02-03 * Sell to customer AAA
          ; Customer: AAA
          ; Invoice: 103
          Assets:Receivables                        12.00 GBP
          Income:Sale                              -12.00 GBP

      2011-02-03 * Money received from customer AAA for invoice 101
          ; Customer: AAA
          ; Invoice: 101
          Assets:Cash                               10.00 GBP
          Assets:Receivables                       -10.00 GBP

      Now you can see how much each customer owes you:

      ledger -f d bal assets:receivables --pivot Customer
                 23.00 GBP  Customer
                 12.00 GBP    AAA:Assets:Receivables
                 11.00 GBP    BBB:Assets:Receivables
      --------------------
                 23.00 GBP

      And you can see which invoices haven't been paid yet:

      ledger -f d bal assets:receivables --pivot Invoice
                 23.00 GBP  Invoice
                 11.00 GBP    102:Assets:Receivables
                 12.00 GBP    103:Assets:Receivables
      --------------------
                 23.00 GBP

* Reporting to Single Currency

  Another oft-requested feature is the ability to boil down all assets to a
  single target currency, converting to cost, and then to the final currency.
  The point is to show a single column of value which can be operated on.


* Plugins

  I've had various ideas for writing new plugins, some make sense, some don't,
  but in any case, these accumulate here.

  - Would it make sense for every plugin to provide a validation function? We
    could then move all the validation routines in their plugin file. I very
    much like this idea: it creates more isolation for routines and less
    dependencies. Open/Close, Balance checks, do seem to be able to fit in this
    category. Those functions should return only a single list of errors, no
    entries, and the calling function should perform a simple hash check to
    ensure that the mutable portion of the entries hasn't been modified by the
    user-provided validation functions.
    'beancount.ops.documents' could benefit from this split.

** Plugin: sellgains

  - This would probably benefit in being renamed to 'check_gains', a better
    name.

** Plugin: flagged_subset

  - Idea: Write two plugins...

    * One that check that all the postings with a particular flag on them
      balance to zero.

    * One that forks out all postings with a particular flag to a separate
      transaction.

    This is from an email thread with redstreet0 in Jan 2015:

    I said: "

       - Define yourself a special account under a common base, e.g. Equity:Extra:*
         for all those special accounts.
       - Write a plugin that will ensure that for all transactions that include at
         least one posting on an Equity:Extra account, the sum of all the weights of
         these postings is zero.
       - If you want to automatically fill in missing postings these accounts, you can
         also do that from a plugin.
       - Your plugin should be configurable with the root account you want to make
         special in that way, in this case "Equity:Extra". See other plugins for how
         to pass in a configuration.
       - You can optionally filter out all those Equity:Extra:* postings in the
         reports using the FROM syntax. Otherwise the detail of the Equity:Extra
         accounts in the balance sheet will be pretty harmless anyhow, but you could
         remove it.

       Note that instead of identifying these special postings using a known root
       account, you could instead trigger that capability by using posting flags.

       (Also, note that if all you care about is the balanced virtual accounts, that's
       entirely equivalent to a second transaction on the same date. I could be
       convinced to add that in, a special state for a subset of postings, as a
       "shadow transaction" whereby the parser splits the single transaction into two
       separate ones, perhaps adding a tag to the shadow one so that you can filter
       them out at will. That could be implemented as a plugin, BTW, separating
       postings that have a particular flag on them.)

    ". This could be used to simulate balanced virtual postings.

** Plugin: alt_date

  - Create a plugin that allows you to replace the date with some of the
    metadata fields, e.g. to create alternative date histories.

      "Note that if you _really_ badly wanted alternative history, you could you could
      easily enter alternative dates as metadata (Beancount will recognize and parse
      a datetime.date type as a value for metadata) and you coudl write _very_ simple
      plugin that converts all the transactions to use the alternative date where
      present in the metadata (or otherwise leave the date as is). You could even
      define yourself multiple different sets of alternative dates by using different
      metadata fields... you can go crazy if you like and create multiple versions of
      history that way. But that would be segregated to a plugin so I'm comfortable
      with it, do whatever you like in plugins, they're perfect for experimentation."

** Plugin: unverified

  - Idea! Allow the selection or reporting of all the postings since their
    balance check in each account. These postings can be called "unverified"
    and it should be possible to report just those. Maybe we can restrict
    further to the list of those without a '*' flag, or maybe just those with a
    '!' flag. "Show me all that's unverified right now."

    Can this be accomplished with the shell? I suppose a new plugin could be
    created to flag unverified entries with meta-data and then filter on that.
    That's probably the best way to do this.

** Plugin: no_zero_amounts

  - Move the check for zero units ("Amount is zero" from the parser) to a
    plugin, and make this selectively removable.

** Plugin: no_unused_pad

  - The validation check that pushes an error on unused pad directives should
    be moved to a plugin, that should be optional. There is rationale for
    allowing to keep unused pad directives. Don't be so strict, Martin.


** Plugin: init_pad

  - Idea: a plugin that autopads all initial balance assertions! Do it for
    demos, will be very useful for making demos easier, not having to be so
    strict.

  - Write a plugin that automatically inserts a padding directive for accounts
    with no open directive and with a balance check.

** Plugin: multi_pad

  - New plugin type: a kind of spreaded Pad directive, that creates multiple
    pads at regular intervals. This is to deal with smooth cash distributions or
    work meals assignment. You should be able to specify the frequency and
    have it automatically insert a number of entries to spread the expense
    evenly. 'evenpad', 'multipad', 'distribution'? This should most definitely
    be a plugin.

** Plugin: cost_pad

  - (pad) Review the possibility of padding units held at cost:

      "The reason it fails is that there must have been units of those commodities
      held at cost before the pad date, and it is an error to pad commodities at
      cost, because Beancount has no way to know what the cost basis of those
      commodities should be."

** Plugin: auto_remove

  - Add a auto-remove-unused part of the auto_accounts plugin,
    that automatically removes Open directives for unused accounts. This is
    useful for demos and such.

** Plugin: monotonic

  - Write a plugin that enables a check that all postings' amounts are of the
    correctly allowed sign, e.g. Expenses should almost always be a positive
    amount, Income a negative one, Assets can be both, also Liabilities. If an
    amount is posted in the contra direction, this should trigger a warning,
    unless the transaction is flag with a particular character, or some special
    tag is present.


** Plugin: match_pending

  - Implement beancount.plugins.tag_pending as a general feature of links...
    this ought to be built-in by default, this is a great idea.

** Plugin: balance_constraint

  - Idea: You could add a further constraint property to an account name: that
    the amounts may never be allowed to balance to a particular sign. This
    could be useful to avoid data entry mistakes. You could even write a doc
    just focused on all features designed to avoid data entry mistakes.

  - Create a verification plugin that verifies that the balance of an account
    does not go under some negative threshold below/above zero. This way you
    could check that account balances are of the expected size. (The plugin
    should accept transient negative balances within the day though, as those
    are order-dependent.)

** Plugin: tip_calculator

  - Write another example plugin that splits "Expenses:Restaurant" legs into
    two two postings: "Expenses:Restaurant x 83%" and "Expenses:Tips x 17%".

** Plugin: gifi_reporting

  - You could write a script to automatically fill this form:
    http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/rc4088/rc4088-12e.pdf

      "With Beancount, one thing that would be doable _outside_ of Beancount, as
    a separate script, is to associate a set of accounts to these GIFI codes and
    automatically generate the forms."

** Plugin: sans_cost

  Capital Gain Without Cost.

  - Implement the proposal for putting the capital gain in the cost as a plugin
    that transforms the relevant transactions, those tagged as such. This will
    require some loosening of the booking method in order to make it easier to
    disambiguate a sale, and some good debugging tools as well.

    You could automatically look for the right amounts by looking at the signs.
    I think you could automate a lot of it.

  - Compare with what I've done for wash sales for TY2015.

** Plugin: avco_checker

  Strict Average Cost Inventory Booking Checker.

  - Build a plugin that will check that accounts with average cost inventory
    booking method only have such reductions in them:

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F8IJ_7fMHZ75XFPocMokLxVZczAhrBRBVN9uMhQFCZ4/edit#heading=h.m74dwkjzqojh

      "Another approach would be to not enforce these aggregations, but to provide a
      plugin that would check that for those accounts that are marked as using the
      average cost inventory booking method by default, that only such bookings
      actually take place."

   This is, of cource, to be implemented only after implementing support for
   the average cost inventory booking method.

** Plugin: match_pending

  - Write a plugin that will pair up (link) matching transactions posting to a common
    account; this could be used to properly pair up the transactions to
    Liabilities:AccountsPayable, which would be very useful.

** Plugin: at_cost_only

  - Idea for one of those constraint plugins: Create a plugin whereby you
    declare some currencies and assert that any units in them are always held at
    cost.

** Plugin: subset_balances

  - Create a plugin that filters out postings with a particular per-posting
    flag, and that checks that they are balanced by themselves.


** Super-Plugins: Pedantic & Auto

  There are two groups of plugins which I use quite often, and would benefit
  from it being possible to enable all at the same time: "auto everything" and
  "super pedantic." Ideally the list of actual plugins being run would be
  expanded in the loader. I think we ought to just make the loader support
  modules in its __plugins__ attribute, and it would insert them this way in
  options_map, and run them individually, or maybe use another module attribute,
  e.g. __plugins_delegate__ or whatever..

  - (pedantic) Create a new plugin-of-plugins which enables all the possible
    constraining other plugins in order to make Beancount as tight as possible
    by default. Making the hardcore validation into a plugin might be a good way
    to provide a strict mode. You could build a "beancount.plugins.pedantic"
    plugin-of-plugins.

  - (auto) Create a new plugin-of-plugins which enables all the auto-declaration
    plugins in order to make crafting little test files as convenient as
    possible. I do this all the time, I need this actually. You could build a
    "beancount.plugins.auto" plugin-of-plugins.

  - Put all verification plugins, including nounused and noduplicates under
    beancount.plugins.constraints.*.

* Payees as Subaccounts

  Payees whose transactions always post to the same expense accounts may be
  viewed as sub-accounts of those accounts, in some sense. I've been toying with
  the idea of taking advantage of this in various ways. For example, one could
  break down the balance of an account by payee, or conversely, use the leaf
  account name as the payee itself (and remove it). I'm not sure if this useful.
  This would also require some clean payee names. This section contains some
  ideas about that.

  - Idea: Allow sub-account names to include a special character, e.g., '#',
    (only one) that would indicate to the reporting facilities that, by default,
    the aggregation should be reported to the parent account. A "detail" or
    "verbose" switch could be used to trigger the detailing of subaccounts. For
    example,

       Expenses:Health:Medical:#Claims
       Expenses:Health:Medical:#PatientSavings
       Expenses:Health:Medical:#ClaimsPayments

    would be reported as

      Expenses:Health:Medical

    by default, but with the detailed switch, would be reported as

       Expenses:Health:Medical:Claims
       Expenses:Health:Medical:PatientSavings
       Expenses:Health:Medical:ClaimsPayments

    This could be used for various subaccounts actually. It's a nice way to
    guide reporting that does not complexify the semantics.

  - Idea: in the query language, provide a special Account:Payee field, in
    order to play with the notion of payee-as-subacccount often discussed.

  - About the discrepancy between the concept of "Payee" and a superfluous lead
    account, e.g. Internet:TimeWarner, which typically contains only
    transactions from that payee: maybe we can elide the account name if it
    contains only a single payee, or perhaps a warning may be issued? I don't
    know.

    Basically, it would be nice to be able to have multiple payees in the same
    category over time (e.g. Electricity, Internet) but to be able to separate
    them somehow, without having to put the payee into the name. This is a
    little fuzzy, and I'm not sure how to do it, because the imported payee
    names are often not very clear and often truncated as well.

      Have you ever thought that Payees often end up functioning like an extra
    subaccount? I've come to realize that for Payees that only ever touch a
    single account, the line is really fuzzy there. I've been entertaining the
    idea of automatically creating subaccounts for payees like that.

  - Write a script that will highlight some "payee vs tags vs subaccount"
    invariants:
    * Highlight payees that are always used with the same accounts
    * Same with tags

** Old Notes

  - Create a plugin that will define subaccounts for payees within accounts and
    modify all the transactions accordingly. This would be a great way to kick
    the tires on this idea without affecting the rest of the system.

      Expenses:Electricity:ConEdison
      Expenses:Phone:TMobile
      Expenses:Groceries:WholeFoodsMarket
      Expenses:Groceries:UnionMarket

  - Should we define some notion of the default level for aggregation, per
    account? For example, in Expenses:Electricity:ConEdison, the default level
    of aggregation should be Expenses:Electricity. If we define that, using
    subaccounts should not bother us much.

* Budgets & Temporal Constraints

  The concept of "budgeting" should be implemented as a list of constraints on
  top of what Beancount already offers. It could be segregated to a plugin, as
  long as the input syntax is powerful enough to support it. Some people in the
  'fava' team have already begun experimenting and that's why I added support
  for a Custom directive. However, eventually this should be formalized a bit
  more and unknown directives should be let to trickle through, and for plugins
  to either register a validation function for the expected data types that were
  seen (this wouldn't be grammar-level parsing, would have to be after the
  grammar has run) or for them to validate their matching directives directly.

  - It would be useful to create a directive that checks that the balance
    of an account in a time interval is lesser or greater than some specific
    amount, e.g.

       Expenses:US:TY2014:SocSec      <= 7254 USD  ;; 6.2% of 117,000 USD
       Expenses:US:TY2015:SocSec      <= 7347 USD  ;; 6.2% of 118,500 USD

  - "Envelope budgeting" is easily implemented like this:

    * A sub-account of a real assets account is market as special.
    * Those sub-accounts are used to transfer funds from their parent account.
      They are constrained to only ever transfer funds to and from that parent
      account.
    * Their transactions can simply be filtered out in order to remove the
      budgeting aspect.
    * You should be able to report balances on these accounts. In fact, since
      they're marked as special, you should be able to gather all of them and
      report the balances of all the envelopes. That's the summarization for the
      budgeting function.
    * Finally, some level of automation should be provided to automatically
      replenish the enveloped at some set frequency (e.g. the beginning of each
      month), including rolling unspent amounts.


** Plugin: budget

  - Implement a plugin that defines and enforces budget constraints.

  - Look at this syntax for an example of a recurring transaction specification:
    https://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind
    (Sumitted by user comment.)

** Budgeting / Goals

  - We could easily add features for budgeting, e.g. somehow set goals and then
    report on the difference between actual and the goal, and project in the
    future according to rate, e.g.:

       ;; Check that the total for this position between 2013-06-01 and 2013-12-31 < 800 USD
       2013-12-31 goal  Expenses:US:Restaurant  2013-06-01  < 800 USD

       ;; Check that the balance of this account on 2013-12-31 is >= 1000 USD
       2013-12-31 goal  Assets:Savings  >= 1000 USD

* Filtering
** Views

  - Replace all views by filtering queries... the root page should still have
    convenient links to various preset views, like the last five years, but
    these links should be implemented using the filtering query feature!
    Maybe it's worth allowing the user to specify common queries in the options
    map, and provide links to them. Do this, and try removing some of my
    subaccounts to simplify the accounts-trees somewhat.

  - The root page should feature a prominent input form that allows the user to
    specify a query! This input needs live at the very root

  - (views) You should be able to filter to all transactions related to some
    account, e.g. Immigration

  - IMPORTANT! Try to let through some of the non-transaction entries in the
    view filtering. We obviously cannot let through balance entries, but
    documents yes, depending on the type of filtering. We should do our best to
    let all the entries carry through.

** Custom dimensions

  - From discussion:

       | (digression not about virtual postings but answers auxiliary questions about
       | them)
       |
       | Now this points to a more general idea that I've been pondering for a while:
       | these "accounts" can often be seen as a set of flat dimensions, the fact that
       | they have a hierarchy can get in the way. I tend to have accounts that look
       | like this:
       |
       |   TYPE:COUNTRY:INSTITUTION:ACCOUNT:SUBACCOUNT
       |
       | like this, for example:
       |
       |   Assets:US:HSBC:Checking
       |   Assets:CA:RBC:Savings
       |
       | For these four dimensions, I actually like having most accounts (Assets,
       | Liabilities and Income) specify them in this order. This does not always make
       | sense though, especially for expense accounts; for those you wouldn't really
       | want to have a COUNTRY dimension at the root. You want the general category
       | only, so I'll have, for example:
       |
       |   Expenses:Food:Restaurant
       |   Expenses:Food:Grocery
       |
       | but sometimes the dimensions get inverted too, like in my recent change about
       | how to track taxation:
       |
       |   Expenses:Taxes:US:TY2014:Employer:Federal
       |   Expenses:Taxes:US:TY2014:Employer:StateNY
       |   Expenses:Taxes:US:TY2014:Employer:CityNYC
       |   ...
       | Here the "institution" is your employer, and shows deeper in the hierarchy.
       | Finally, you often do want to have multiple types for the same or similar
       | accounts, for instance, to track gains and dividends income from a particular
       | investment account, you want a mirror of most of the dimensions except for the
       | assets bit:
       |
       |   Assets:US:ETrade:IRA -> Income:US:ETrade:IRA
       |
       | For instance:
       |
       |   Assets:US:ETrade:IRA:Cash
       |   Income:US:ETrade:IRA:Dividends
       |
       | You see what I'm getting at... these components really operate more like a
       | database table with values possibly NULL, e.g.,
       |
       |   type     country  institution  account   category
       |   -------- -------- ------------ --------- -----------
       |   Assets   US       HSBC         Checking  NULL
       |   Assets   CA       RBC          Savings   NULL
       |   Assets   US       ETrade       IRA       Cash
       |   Income   US       ETrade       IRA       Dividends
       |   Expenses NULL     NULL         Food      Restaurant
       |   Expenses NULL     NULL         Food      Grocery
       |
       | Having to order your account components in a hierarchy forces you to
       | decide how you want to report on them, a strict order of grouping from
       | top to bottom.
       | So I've been thinking about an experiment to rename all accounts according to
       | dimensions, where the ordering of the components would not matter. These two
       | would point to the same bucket, for example (changing the syntax slightly),
       |
       |   Expenses|Taxes|US|TY2014|Employer|Federal
       |   Expenses|US|Employer|Taxes|TY2014|StateNY
       |
       | You could then display reports (again, the usual reports, balance sheet,
       | income statement, journals) for "the subset of all transactions which has one
       | posting in an account in <set>" where <set> is defined by values on a list of
       | dimensions, a bit like a WHERE clause would do.
       |
       | Now, now, now... this would be a bit radical, now wouldn't it? Many of these
       | accounts do point to real accounts whose postings have to be booked exactly,
       | and I'm a bit worried about the looseness that this could introduce. One and
       | only one account name for a particular account is a nice property to have.
       |
       | So what can we do to select across many dimensions while still keeping
       | hierarchical account names?
       |
       | The first thing I did in Beancount is to create views for all unique account
       | component names. For example, if the following account exists:
       |
       |   Assets:US:ETrade:IRA
       |
       | You will see four "view" links at the root of the Beancount web page:
       |
       |   Assets
       |   US
       |   ETrade
       |   IRA
       |
       | Clicking on the link selects all the transactions with a posting with an
       | account where that component appears. (Views provide access to all the reports
       | filtered by a subset of transactions.) You can click your way to any journal
       | or report for that subset of transactions. This exists in HEAD today. You can
       | draw all the reports where a particular component appears, e.g., "Employer", as
       | in "Income:US:Employer:Salary" and "Expenses:Taxes:US:TY2014:Employer:Federal".
       |
       | But this does not define "dimensions." It would be nice to group values for
       | these components by what kind of thing they are, e.g., a bank, an instution, a
       | country, a tax year, etc, without regard for their location in the account
       | name. A further experiment will consist in the following:  again assuming
       | unique "account component names" (which is not much of a constraint to
       | require, BTW, at least not in my account names), allow the user to define
       | dimensions by declaring a list of component names that form this dimension.
       | Here's how this would look, with the previous examples (new syntax):
       |
       |   dimension employer  Microsoft,Autodesk,Apple
       |   dimension bank      HSBC,RBC,ETrade
       |   dimension country   US,CA,AU
       |   dimension taxyear   TY2014,TY2013,TY2012,TY2011,TY2010
       |   dimension type      Assets,Liabilities,Equity,Income,Expenses (implicit?)
       |
       | You could then say something like "show me trial balance for all transactions
       | with posting accounts where bank is not NULL group by bank" and you would
       | obtain mini-hierarchies for each group of accounts (by bank, across all other
       | dimensions).
       |
       | (With the state of my current system, I could probably code this as a
       | prototype in a single day.)
       |
       | Addtionally, accounts have currency constraints and a history of postings
       | which define a set o currencies used in them. More selection can be done with
       | this (e.g., show me all transactions with postings that credit/debit CAD
       | units).
       |
       | IMHO, all you're trying to do with these virtual accounts is aggregate with
       | one less dimension, you want to remove the real account and group by community
       | project. My claim is that there are ways to do that without giving up o the
       | elegant balancing rules of the DE system.

    In relation to this... these "dimensions", could they just become other
    dimensions in the filtering language?

      component:Microsoft

      employer:Microsoft
      bank:RBC
      country:US

    You can then break down by those, like a GROUP BY clause, and generate
    reports that have those as root accounts, or separate breakdowns.

** Tags used as dimensions

  - If you had tags as key-value pairs, those could be used as well:

      2014-05-21 * ...
        #employer:Microsoft

    Searching for:

      tag:employer=Microsoft

    This is another dimension in the same filtering language.

* Operations
** Validation

  - Write a dedicated routine to check the following invariant:

        # Handle sanity checks when the check is at the beginning of the day.
        check_is_at_beginning_of_day = parser.SORT_ORDER[Check] < 0
        ...
        if check_is_at_beginning_of_day:
            # Note: Check entries are assumed to have been sorted to be before any
            # other entries with the same date. This is supposed to be done by the
            # parser. Verify this invariant here.
            if isinstance(entry, (Check, Open)):
                assert entry.date > prev_date, (
                    "Invalid entry order: Check or Open directive before transaction.",
                    (entry, prev_entry))
            else:
                prev_entry = entry
                prev_date = entry.date

  -  Sanity check: Check that all postings of Transaction entries point to their
     actual parent.

  - (validation) In addition to the Check/Open before-constraint, check that
    the entries are always sorted. Add this sanity check.

  - The default validation should check the invariant that Open and Check
    directives come before any Transaction.

  - Validation: Everywhere we have a filter of entries to entries, we should be
    able to apply a check that the total balances before and the total balances
    after should have the very same value.

  - In validate.py: differentiate between the case of an entry appearing too
    early before an Open directive, and an entry appearing for an account that
    simply just doesn't exist.

  - Auto-detect and warn on likely duplicate transactions within the file.

** Padding

  - Idea: Padding entries could be extended a tiny bit in order to
    automatically calculate the cash distribution entries, e.g., like this:

      2014-03-04 pad Asset:Cash  Expenses:Restaurant    60%
      2014-03-04 pad Asset:Cash  Expenses:Alcohol       40%

      2014-04-04 pad Asset:Cash  Expenses:Restaurant    70%
      2014-04-04 pad Asset:Cash  Expenses:Alcohol       30%

      2014-05-04 pad Asset:Cash  Expenses:Restaurant    70%
      2014-05-04 pad Asset:Cash  Expenses:Alcohol       30%

    This is a great idea, is in line with the general meaning of pad entries
    (implicit 100%) and would add a much desired feature.

  - Add tests for all the cases of realization padding.

** Locations

  - @location really should just convert into a generic event "location", just
    as address and school should; they're just events with forward fill...
    Serve this at:

       http://localhost:8080/20120101/20130101/events/location/days

  - Add a "reason" field for @location, and display as trips, with
    some sort of meaning to them. Ok, this contradicts the previous idea.



* Parser
** Errors

  - Parsing an indented string results in some output... for example, this code
    spits out a single Balance entry (the last one):

        balance_entries, _, __ = parser.parse_string("""
          2014-01-02 balance Liabilities:CreditCard   100.00 USD
          2014-01-03 balance Liabilities:CreditCard   200.00 USD
        """)

    It should not. It should output nothing, because these entries are indented.
    I don't understand why it does. This is a parser bug which needs to be
    traced and debugged. This has come up in writing tests here and there,
    forgetting to insert dedent=True.

  - We need to gather errors in a single place and report them like the others;
    right now I'm catching them in sum_to_date() and writing using the logging
    module; but they really should be trickled up with the rest.

  - Syntax errors currently have no location... this is unacceptable. Write an
    automated test, check for all kinds of errors, in the lexer, in the parser,
    in the Python. (Just work with the line number, we don't really need
    character position.) Test everything with automated tests.

  - 'lineno' is incorrect, it points to the next entry, not the previous one,
    fix this bug! This is really annoying.

  - Set a correct filename in grammar.y

  - Errors from the parser and others should all be accumulated in one place,
    so that we do all the reporting at the very top level.

  - Don't raise error exceptions anywhere; log everything to an error
    handler/accumulator class instead, and skip to the next entry/declaration.
  - Propagate exception from Python(?)

  - Problematic transactions (!) should spit something of color on stdout, they
    should not be forgotten so easily.

  - Bug: Invalid account names should only be reported once.

** Lexer Work
*** Errors in Flex Lexer

  - (parser) Support enabling flex debugging in beancount.core._parser.parse(),
    using "yyset_debug(int bdebug)".

  - When an error occurs, skip the lexer to the next empty line and recommence.

    * Modify the lexer to emit EOF and add that in the grammar rules for empty_line.

*** Write a New Lexer From Scratch

  Reasons to write your own lexer manually:

  - Should support UTF-8 encoding.

  - Should support SCHEDULE entries for org-mode (see email discussion).
  - More flexible syntax (see "Is it possbile for beancount to ignore org-mode
    SCHEDULED and DEADLINE?" thread).

  - Better error reporting

  - (performance) Write your own lexer manually and compare performance with
    flex one. I think we can do a much better job at error reporting by writing
    our own, but I'm unsure how the performance compares.

  - IMPORTANT LATENT ISSUE. You need to extend the lexer to parse A-Z for flags,
    not just PSTCU! This is important, as I just realized that it could prevent
    the correct parsing for entries in a round-trip, with postings produced with
    unexpected flags. In fact, any character with whitespace on each side should
    parse as a flag. This is very important.

    This manifests when adding a posting with letter 'M' right now. Replicate
    this, fix the problem.

** Make the Parser Reentrant

  - Make the parser reentrant [2014-08-02]. This is _not_ a difficult task.

    * Follow this:
      https://www.lemoda.net/c/reentrant-parser/
      http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/Extra-Data.html
      to remove all globals from my lexer and make it truly reentrant and free of globals.

    * You need to add unit tests that check the correctness of line numbers on
      parsed directives and errors.

    * You need to remove the get_yylineno and get_yyfilename accessors.

    * You need to make the parser reentrant, by add this directive to the grammar:

         %parse-param { PyObject* builder}

      You also need to redefine yyerror() accordingly. I've done it and it
      works, it's simple, it's a 20 minute change:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Parser-Function.html

    * You also need to make the lexer reentrant:
      http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/Reentrant-Overview.html#Reentrant-Overview

         %option reentrant

      (I haven't tried this yet.)

    * Most of the "real" work involved is in removing the globals for lineno and
      filename.

    * Make sure the performance does not degrade as a result of doing this.

** Syntax

  - You should support a payee with no description! This generates a parser
    error right now.

  - The syntax should support multiline strings naturally...

  - For Links vs. Tags: dont impose an order, parse as tags_or_links.
    Right now the order is tags_list and links_list.

  - You should accept commas in the input; simply ignore their value.

  - Add 1/rate syntax for prices (and anything... really, why not).
    Convert at parsing time.

*** Sensible Syntax for Lots

  - Consider making the lot syntax like this:

       -4 {HOOL @ 790.83 USD}

    instead of:

       -4 HOOL {790.83 USD}

    It's actually a lot more accurate to what's going on...

** Testing

  - Allow file objects to parse() and dump_lexer(). This should use fdopen() or
    whatever else to get this job done at the parser level.

  - You need to clean up the memory of the strings created; call free() on each
    string in the rules.

  - Add a unit test for pushtag/poptag errors.
  - Add unittests for tags, pushtag/poptag

* Reports
** Text Statements

  - Complete text-statements branch, printing out balance sheet and income
    statement to text for bean-report and ELI, complete with --date on those
    reports.

 - Using an intermediate data structure, produce text and csv / xls reports,
   downloadable from the web front-end, or even generatable directly. All of
   this reporting infrastructure should be reusable, ideally.

  - A text rendering of the balance sheet / income statement would be
    _very_ useful for collaboration/communication with others. Add a link to
    download a text version of any report. This would be made easy if we only
    have a few distinct types of reports.

** List of Unreconciled Transactions and Postings

  - Perhaps we want to produce a report of all transactions with a highlight on
    them.

** Balance Sheet

  - (web) We really need to reorder the accounts in a way that is more
    sensible... it's annoying to see the accounts I care about at the top of
    the page. Cash, Points, AU, should be at the bottom... I wonder if there's
    a nice heuristic. Last updated date? I think that would be good enough.

  - We need to figure out how to order the accounts on the balsheet; I want the
    most relevant near the top. Sorting accounts: compute a score made up of

    * nb. txns from the last 3 months
    * nb. checks from the last 3 months (weighted more heavily)
    * line-no of Open directive in the file.
    * last updated date.

** HTML Rendering

  - Rendering: When you collapse a parent account, its aggregate amount should
    render, and disappear when not collapsed.

  - Numbers should align to the right.

  - USD and CAD should be aggregated in their own columns for balance sheet and
    income statements. These should be specified from the command-line.

  - All entries should have collapsing a-la-JavaScript, along with
    collapse/reveal all buttons. All JS.

  - If the software is finally fast enough in Go, render RESTful on the fly for
    any date:

    * REST:  /balsheet/20121231/
    * REST:  /income/20121231/20131231/

    This way, you could have any year on the same run. No need to restart, even
    have a menu with all the years, and perhaps even some of the latest months.

  - It would be really nice to render the line numbers to the source in the HTML

  - (Performance) Implement buffered output for faster response using a separate
    thread and an iterator that yields from app.write when the data buffer is
    large enough.

  - Postings that have a "!" flag should have at least their
    background red.

  - You should more explicitly state the beginning and ending period
    on each statement pages (it is super important information).
    Just below the title.



** Excel Output

  - Find good ways to transfer data to an Excel spreadsheet. A link to download
    a file should be supported.


** Links to Source

  - The new format code should keep and optionally render the source file/line
    of any transaction, and allow clicking to get to the source line in the
    rendering.

  - Maybe there should be a script that can take a report specification and
    output a list of emacs-compatible links to the entries, interspersed with
    the text format rendering! You could go "next-error" to go through the
    entries in time order, emacs taking you there one-by-one.

** Event Reports

  - We should be able to count the days of each event type.

** Distribution of Expenses and Income

  - Add a pie chart to visualize the constitution of the Income Statement for
    Expenses and Income.

** Summary Reports

  - To create custom views, for example, weekly summaries, you could
    convert the ledger into another ledger, where entries would have
    been replaced by summary entries instead, and all the other
    functionalities would still work.

** Financial Ratio Analysis

  - Add these: https://www.csun.edu/~bjc20362/Controlling-2.pdf

** Trades

  - You should be able to report on all booked trades during a period,
    especially with the new booking algorithm, this will be useful.
    Create a new report type for this.

** Reports: Overview Stats

  - Add a simple overview 'stats' report with output like this:

      Files these postings came from:
        ...

      Unique payees:            2681
      Unique accounts:           151

      Number of postings:       9026 (4.8 per day)
      Uncleared postings:        126

      Days since last post:     -206
      Posts in last 7 days:       30
      Posts in last 30 days:      52
      Posts seen this month:       8

  - This ought to replace the current stats reports, which are simply too small
    and specialized.

** Reports: Rendering Journals

  - Journals should render in either order.

  - Add an option for spacing in the revamped reports.

  - When multiple transactions occur in the same day, it makes sense not to
    render the balance amount until the last one. Do this. This is important.

  - In rendering balance directives, don't render the amount in the "change"
    column; that is too confusing for some users, keep the change column for
    changes.

  - (easy) Don't render postings in the HTML interface by default. The detail
    can be made available via bean-query now, and users can click on /context
    link in order to get the full transaction detail. Journals should be
    summaries. Add an optional argument to turn it on/off, but it should be off
    by default.

** Reports: Rendering Tables of Balances

  - tree rendering: If a parent account has only a single subaccount and the
    parent account otherwise has no postings in its realization, render the
    account on a single line instead of two, e.g.

      Expenses                     Expenses
        Taxes                        Taxes
          US                           US
            TY2014                       TY2014
              State                        State:Company
                Company                    ...
              ...

** Reports: Rendering Tables

  - For table rendering, move the actual formatting at rendering time. CSV files
    should have fractional values for percentages, txt and html should have %
    values. I need to figure out a good solution for this. Maybe the thing to do
    is to move the field selection at rendering stage, or at least to have it at
    both.

** Reports: Accounts

  - bean-report accounts should produce a regular table that can be rendered
    with CSV or TXT, not a custom output string.

** Reports: Cash

  - Create a function to identify whether a Position/Inventory is cash... use
    this to reproduce/replace the 'cash' report. Use the same rule from
    bean-report.

** Report: XML

  - Output to a structured XML format, some people are finding that useful to
    build other visualizations. In order to test this completely, do a
    round-trip test.  The code should live in beancount.parser, parallel to the
    existing code there.

** Report: Events

  - Build a 'events' report that will print out the current value of all events.

  - Create a new report type: "days" that counts the days of any event in the
    filtered log.

* Price Freshness / Dated Prices

  - Issue warnings if the price date is too far from the requested market value
    date. This will help with returns, a lot. You should likely do this in the
    price_map object, in the lookup function, maybe, so that all modules benefit
    from the feature. You could ideally provide a date and a tolerance, and
    somehow issue warnings automatically. The tolerance for price freshness
    should be provided as an option in the input file.

  - Add the capability to issue warnings when the price database is queried for
    a specific date but the price point is too distant from the requested date.

      "One thing I want to do soon is to issue warnings when the price database is
      looked up and the price point is too far from the requested date, so that the
      user could go fill in the missing prices. I'd probably issue price entries with
      the approximated price (approximated with a distant date) and then feed that
      into another script that would fetch prices for those directives."

* Review Design of Tags & Links

  - Consider removing the "links" attribute altogether and making that simply
    just a tag. Do we really, truly need to distinguish between tags and links?

  - Try removing the 'tags' attribute of transactions by moving it to metadata
    fields and making sure tools are available to perform the same aggregations
    using bean-query and views using bean-web.

  - Make the Pad directive accept #tags and propagate those to the generated
    transactions:
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/70/add-tag-to-the-pad-directive-and-propagate

* Web Interface Improvements

  - (easy) Make b.w.web also 'app.options_map' instead of 'app.options'.

  - Make the web interface not render postings anymore by default.

  - web: Don't render the transaction detail anymore; instead, the full context
    should come up in a tooltip that is computed on-demand. Rendering the basic
    table should not have to render all the detail upfront, that is always
    overkill.

  - web: Don't render the full Inventory'es; instead, already render at cost and
    provide their full detail either by clicking on the transaction, which
    should render the full detail of an inventory (for debugging), or in a
    tooltip.

  - Highlight (e.g., in the color red) the postings to accounts that are in
    contra value, e.g. a positive Income, or a negative Expenses posting.
    (Maybe this is just something that lives in Fava actually)

  - In the web interface, it would be nice to have a fancy client-side
    JavaScript overlay here, that automatically appears after parsing if there
    are errors and that automatically smoothly fades out. All errors should be
    displayed in an overlay; proper error handling and display for the web
    interface is not optional, it's important.

  - Figure out how to disable googleapis fonts when on a very slow connection.
    I'd like to enable the fonts, but if they cannot be fetched quickly, or
    cached, this should be disabled.

  - Implement a little plug-ins system that allows a user to insert a new tab in
    bean-web, to insert some custom display.

  - Instead of rendering inventories with the full contents in the journal,
    render the cost, and place the full inventory in a tooltip!

  - A table of price entries should be rendered under the price graph in the
    web interface.

  - The Trial Balance page could be a good place to put all the accounts on the
    left and have two sets of columns: beginning of period -> end of period.

  - In order to implement .txt output, you will need to decouple the web
    rendering and the generation of its included data. This will be
    great--ability to cut-and-paste any page into txt. format=txt, and we could
    still have the links clickable. Everything else would just be txt. A bit of
    a crazy idea, but it might work well and be simple. Maybe.

  - Render tags on the HTML page

  - Replace gviz charts by some other library that does not require you to be
    online in order for it to work.

  - Silence BrokenPipeError errors from bottle using wsgiref. You could use
    CherryPy, which doesn't suffer from that, or just... fix it and silence
    them.

  - In balance/aggregate reports, render the balances for parent accounts too,
    in lighter gray.

  - Render the Conversions amount at the bottom of the Conversions page...

** Visualizations

  - Move the TreeMaps experimental script for Expenses and Assets subtrees into
    the bean-web codebase:
    https://bost.ocks.org/mike/treemap/
    (Or maybe that would just be left for fava.)

** Rendering Documents

  - Serving CSV files from the Documents page should not done be via download,
    but rather they should rendered directly. Same with text files. As much as
    possible files should be served directly.

  - The documents web page should render by-month + date, and by-account + date.

** Update Activity Page

  - Update activity: Remove parent accounts with no child accounts.
  - Update activity: This exhibits a bug in the table rendering, look for IVV,
    see TODO(blais) in acctree.py

** Bake Improvements

  - Move beancount.scripts.bake to beancount/web and adjust all the references
    accordingly.

  - bake: Make bake support curl if wget is not available. It should work with either,
    to relax dependencies.

  - Make the web scraper run in multiple threads... it's quite a bit too slow as
    it is. I'm sure we can make it scrape in parallel using multiprocessing and
    a work queue (this should be a fun little project and would make baking to
    an archive a lot faster in many cases).

** Programmable View

  - GREAT IDEA! Have a web form that you can input a view filtering expression,
    e.g.  year:2014 component:Microsoft
    to have that year's transactions made with this component. Encode the
    results in a unique string that you can decode and create a corresponding
    view of the subset selected by the expression. You can then view any of the
    reports for that subset! This means we can then get rid of many of the root
    page's links automatically, yet still provide all the opportunities... this
    is the way to go, and would best mirror the command-line capabilities.

** Error reporting

  - We really need to list all the entries markes '!' somewhere; they should be
    more annoying to the user.

  - In the balance sheet or trial balance, mark accounts that have errors in
    red, or add a little red start next to them.

  - Implement basic error reporting page from the list of errors.

** Links

  - (web) Render links to the right of descriptions, and the link href link
    should actually render a page of the related linked entries.

** Aesthetics

  - In the entries table HTML, highlight the relevant posting leg somehow, maybe
    use a '>>' marker, or make it bold. Something. (Bold is too much, use >>.)

  - Render "as of YYYY-MM-DD" under the title for Balance Sheet, and "from
    YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD" under the title for Income Statement

  - Answer to favicon.ico request.

  - Add an option to render the entries table upwards, not just downwards.

  - Use that beautiful new font (Roboto) from Tactile in the new rendering.
    Totally worth it. Use the nice Lucida-like font for numbers, like in
    TurboTax.

*** JavaScript / Client-Side Interaction

  - Render balance sheet/ income statement cells with two numbers for parent
    nodes, so that when you collapse a node, all the amounts of its children sum
    up automatically and display in its cell. You should have a consistent
    report regardless of whether nodes are collapsed or not. This will require
    some JavaScript effort.

  - Implemented a JavaScript cursor in JS. J, K up down. SPC = toggle.

  - In Journal view, pressing 'C' should toggle displaying the checks on and off.

** Trial Balance

  - We should have a nicer way to tell what accounts need to be updated.
    Highlight them red if they haven't been updated in more a month
    (configurable).
    Put the last updated date in the balance sheet or perhaps the trial balance
    page. Should be easy; we don't need a dedicated page for this.

  - Shove more information in the Trial Balance page, info about errors, documents, etc.

** Source

  - The source page should take a special '?line=ddd' parameter that will
    scroll the page to the transaction at that line.

** Conversions


* Small Projects & Challenge Ideas
** Maximum Balance

  - Can I compute the maximum value of each account at the end of every year
    (for foreign assets decl.) This would be useful for FBAR / FATCA
    declarations.

  - Automatically compute the maximum account values of foreign accounts for
    the FBAR filing.

  - You should report a trial-balance -like listing of the minimum and maximum
    values of all the accounts.

** Property Lifetime Return

  - Challenge: Can I compute IRR return on my condo purchase and sale,
    accurately accounting for all the little expenses and cash flows along the
    way? TODO: Add benefits received as an Income, as transactions.

** Taxation Rate

  - Challenge: Can I automatically compute my taxation rate for every year?

** Currency Exposure Report

  - For a particular balance sheet, report the total currency exposure of the
    ledger. This should be a very simple report, probably in the form of a pie
    chart.  Maybe this pie chart should be located in the capital report
    (possibly makes sense).

** Inflation Adjusted Reporting

  - It would be AWESOME to look at a balance sheets from the past but
    inflation-adjusted for any date... Answer this question easily:

      "What was I making in 2010 in today's dollar terms?"

  - How would I produce an inflation adjusted version of some charts. Maybe all
    charts should have that option?

  - Look at average meal 10 years ago, average electricity, etc. things that
    should be equal, and correct for the time-value-of-money, compare prices
    today with prices then. Maybe come up with some kind of constant unit that
    I can convert everything to.

** Account Linkage Report

  - Generate a Graphviz link of all the inter-account transactions that are
    larger than a certain amount.

    Generate a graph for the main kinds of account
    interchanges, by looking at the most significant transactions
    between the accounts. For example, ignore transactions which are
    too small in absolute value, or whose total is too small a portion
    of the total.

    Fun little project: Create a graphviz output from a Ledger, where
    transactions above a certain amount would generate a link between
    accounts. Note:  the threshold could be either for single
    transactions, or for aggregate amounts (absolute value).

** Predict Vacation Cap Date

  - Make an plugin that computes the precise date at which my vacation will cap
    (240 VACHR) base on an account.

* Account Hiding Criterion

  - Set the closing criterion for empty accounts, implement in a single place,
    and review all the code which renders balances to use it.

      "I used to have it so that accounts closed before the beginning of the exercise
      (in the reports) would not appear. Accounts closed at the end of the period but
      with some activity within the period would appear (so you can click on them and
      see their journal). Opened accounts with a zero balance would, too. Closed
      before begin + no activity = no show."

        2000-01-10 open Assets:Continuing
        2000-01-10 open Assets:Empty
        2000-01-10 open Assets:Terminated

        2000-01-10 open Equity:Whatever

        2014-03-10 *
          Assets:Continuing       110 USD
          Assets:Terminated       120 USD
          Assets:Empty            130 USD
          Equity:Whatever

        2014-03-30 *
          Assets:Terminated      -120 USD
          Assets:Empty           -130 USD
          Equity:Whatever

        2014-05-15 close Assets:Terminated

        2015-01-10 *
          Assets:Continuing       110 USD
          Equity:Whatever

  - Whether an account shows up in a particular Ledger (realization) really only
    should depend on whether the account was open during the period (we now have
    account open/close dates... let's use them instead of a heuristic!).
    Create a routine to figure out if an account was open during a specific
    time period?

  - Related topics:
    (ticket) https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/36/balances-output-sometimes-outputs-000
    (fava) https://github.com/aumayr/fava/issues/292#issuecomment-219563582

  - One question is whether we should display an account which has a non-zero
    balance but when rounded for display rounds to a zero number?

      "the problem is not the sell, but the buy
      that leaves -0.00120 USD in Assets:XYZ"

* Rejected Ideas

  - Why aren't we using the price on the first leg of this transaction? This is
    an interesting variation on the meaning of the price: it could mean either
    (a) the price of the lot, or (b) the conversion price of the cost of the
    lot. This would enable the following:

        2013-07-22 * "Bought some US investment in a CAD account"
          Assets:Investment:HOOL           50 HOOL {700 USD} @ 1.01 CAD   ;; 35350 CAD
          Assets:Investment:Cash          -35359.95 CAD
          Expenses:Commissions                 9.95 CAD

  - Add a --auto-everything option to bean-check that automatically inserts a
    beancount.plugins.auto_accounts directive and more.

* To Be Categorized
** Reporting Plugin Errors

  - Build a utility function to parse plugin configs using ast.literal_eval()
    and catch and produce a consistent error message when an invalid Python
    expression is provided. Convert all the plugins to use it.

  - When rendering errors, render the data type so the error tells you which
    component or plugin generated it.

  - Parse and save the line no for "plugin" directives in order to improve their
    error reporting.

** doctor / tools

  - Add a list of posted balances by account to "bean-doctor context".  "linked"
    always links all the transactions, so it's not good enough. Just add this by
    default to the context command.

  - Great idea: Make the printer able to (1) output "incomplete" entries and (2)
    print out the entries in the order of (filename, line-no) in which they were
    parsed, to produce a file that is as close as possible to output. (bw3443
    asked for this in order to make modifications to his input and push that
    back out to a file, this could be useful.)

** Improvements to Emacs Support

  - Investigate indent-region and see if it wouldn't make sense to override this
    in order to invoke beancount-align / beancount-format.

  - Add an Emacs mode command to compute a command at the date of the
    transaction preceding or at the cursor line (with C-u). Without a C-u
    prefix, compute the balances at the latest date. The point is that the user
    shouldn't have to type in the bean-query <filename>, other than perhaps
    having to type "balances". To work quickly on smaller files.

*** Transaction Lists which can be Explored with Emacs

  - Add a "lineno" format for transactions that render in "Emacs errors"
    compatible format, so we can easily jump in time throughout the input file
    instead of rendering a journal. Offer the option to list in reverse to. This
    should be invokable from the SQL shell.

  - Register (with filter) should have "print" mode that also includes
    file:lineno so that we can make Emacs "jump" between the transactions in
    the order they appear.

** Trading

  - Produce example transactions for each of the cases provided by Filippo's
    sample transactions.

** Tools: Formatting

  - BUG: There is a bug in bean-format; on
    /home/blais/sharing-with-roommate/liabilities-account-solution.beancount, it
    fails with an assertion. I highly suspect that it's because of postings like this:
      Expenses:Electricity             45.34/2 USD
      Liabilities:Alice                45.34/2 USD

* Crypto

  Start thinking about some features for crypto users.

  - Make it possible to transfer lots with cost between accounts without having
    to specify the full detail (use matching).

* Misc Grab Bag of Ideas

  Here follows a grab bag of ideas. When I have a new idea coming to me, I don't
  have time to think about where to put it, I just come here at the end and jot
  it down. Every couple of years I clean this mess up and put it in the sections
  above.

  - Add HIGHEST_COST booking method.

  - Make queries with group by order by unaggregated columns by default (output
    should be stable even without ORDER BY clause.

  - IDEA: In linked and context commands, output the sum of all positive and all
    negatives numbers (like "Net Income" sum in 'linked').

  - IDEA: For ugly transactions like this, it's convenient to repeat account
    names and amounts, like this:

      2020-08-09 * "Delta Dental" "Processing claim" ^deltadental-XXXXXXXXXXXx
        service: 2020-08-07
        Expenses:Health:Dental:NonEligible             295.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:NonEligible             -50.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Deductible               50.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:NonEligible          0.20 * -202.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Coinsurance          0.20 *  202.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:NonEligible          0.80 * -202.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Allowed              0.80 *  202.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Reimbursement          -161.60 USD
        Assets:AccountsReceivable:Anthem:Dental

    But we don't want them applied as such. It would be nice to have those
    automatically turned into:

      2020-08-09 * "Delta Dental" "Processing claim" ^deltadental-XXXXXXXXXXXx
        service: 2020-08-07
        Expenses:Health:Dental:NonEligible              43.00 USD  <--- here.
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Deductible               50.00 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Coinsurance              40.40 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Allowed                 161.60 USD
        Expenses:Health:Dental:Reimbursement          -161.60 USD
        Assets:AccountsReceivable:Anthem:Dental

    It's fine if this is done only for postings with the same currency and no
    cost basis, or postings with a particular flag on, or just for some subset
    of accounts. "automeld"? This would be nice in v3, as the original parsed
    transaction can keep all the original detail while the reduced one only
    appears in the finaly flow.

    Or maybe... this shoule be global and automatic?  Impelment it, and print
    out which transactions would be affected to find out.

  - `bean-doctor linked` command should render the balances after each
    transaction. Either horizontally (new columns), or a dedicated tree right
    after each. Add an option. This would be nice for debugging.

  - `bean-doctor linked`: The account types aren't in the correct order. It
    shows Assets, Expenses, Liabilities... put all the balance statemnet
    accounts first, then income statement accounts, finally, equity.

  - Plugin idea: A plugin that ensures that there is no residual commodity in an
    account as of its closing.

  - For Vanguard RothIRA, I need a balance check that applies only to a subset
    of linked transactions. I'm being provided with this number in the imported
    file but I have to split the transactions themselves.

  - Turn all FIXME into TODO(blais) and NOTE(blais).

  - "find $PWD | treeify -F" is broken; used to work. Update and fix this.

  - Make the spreadsheets <-> beancount upload/download conversion scripts more
    general and flexible and provide them to the general public. These are
    really powerful.

  - When env var L is set to a directory, failure just says that the Lex scanner
    fails; this should mention the name of the file, so it's clear. Sometimes I
    override "L".

  - In order to render all linked transactions, support pulling the referenced
    link or tag name under the cursor (in Emacs).

  - In beancount.plugins.auto_accounts: It would be really nice to constraint
    which types accounts can be auto-created, for example, don't auto-create
    Assets/Income accounts. This would be helpful in trip files.

  - Idea! Add original conversion rate on an augmenting leg with cost basis, in
    order to be able to partition profits due to appreciate vs. currency drift.
    See https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/beancount/939fe47e-382a-4272-94e6-dd29f660d519%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer

    "This brings up an interesting point, one which I had never given much
    though before: if we wanted to solve this problem - and I think it may be
    worthwhile to do so - couldn't we just (optionally) store the original
    exchange rate at the time the lot was converted, with the lot (i.e.,
    Position object) itself? That is, each lot would store:
    - units (amount, currency)
    - cost (amount, currency, acquistion-date, label, rate*)
    (*) This being the new bit.

    Given those rates, we should be able to compute the current value of the
    cost basis in the local currency, and that against how much it cost us
    originally, should tell us the proportion of gain/loss due solely to
    currency appreciation/depreciation (ignore the effect relative interest
    differences between the two currencies)."

  - Three interesting ideas for extending booking further here:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/beancount/9c9dcc5f-72bf-44b2-aaf9-4e0c07cbff77%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer

    1. When you apply the partial booking specification, it could be applied
       against the booked legs of the transaction in order to select cost bases.
       I'm not sure if this generalizes.

        "Finally, the partial specification, say, just specifying the date, is
         used to narrow down the lot against the list of possible lots in the
         Inventory of the account before applying the transaction, but NOT against
         the list of other postings. That would be an interesting power to add to
         the booking system, as it could disambiguate this case."

    2. One could assume a single currency group in each transaction when there's
       at least one posting at cost.

    3. One could also assume that in that account a commodity is never priced in
       terms of two different currencies.

  - Allow plugins to run before and after booking; this would make it possible
    for plugins to run on CostSpec and fill in more information. In fact, maybe
    the booking process itself could be moved to a plugin. This coudl be a
    powerful idea, in that it would clarify the distinction between the two
    streams of transactions.

  - Add support for this data source: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/


  - Sometimes it might be useful to end the stream of useful transactions at a
    particular point in the input file. Normally this is best done by filtering
    in the queries themselves, but there are times where having an End
    directives specified temporarily in the input file would have been useful
    (e.g. when traveling and running temporary balances while editing the input
    file). Consider adding this facility, it might be a convenience, especially
    to get around some of the absence of time issues.

  - In the new SQL shell, allow the plugins to define new subsets of postings
    (transactions), so that they can be queries separately. For instance, when
    I'm traveling, it should be possible to query the set of transactions before
    or after the split_expenses plugin ran. This would actually have been useful
    while traveling, because the split_expenses plugin doubles up a lot of the
    postings (that's what it does...).

  - Document the "{ <num> # <num> <ccy> }" syntax properly, in a dedicated place.

  - New currency sources:
    https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html
    https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15616880

  - Idea: Add "contra" as a new column, when the sign posted in the wrong
    direction based on the account type. Or add a boolean "contra" virtual
    column (or function, from account name).

  - Here's another way to implement an intra-day balance: define a new balance
    directive type, whose semantic is tp sort all the entries, but the entries
    on the same day of the balance are sorted in file order. I think this would
    handle the most common use case. Try it (experiment).

  - It might be interesting to support some sort of transfer syntax that would
    allow the movement of Position's across accounts, without converting to the
    cost, something like this:

      2000-01-01 * "Transfer shares from BrokerOne to BrokerTwo to sell at BrokerTwo"
        Assets:BrokerOne     -10 HOOL {}
        Assets:BrokerTwo

    While this example is simple enough, a fully general version of this might
    not be, but it's worth prototyping. This would require some sort of new
    syntax for these "transfers."

  - Rationalize the strategy for reporting errors.

  - Rendering idea: If a posting moved the balance in the unusual direction
    (positive for Income, negative for Expenses), it could be rendered with a
    highlight or a different color. These are rare and unusualy. One could also
    do the same for Assets (when the amount moves up) or Liabilities (when it
    moves down).

  - Create a new "AssertQuery" directive to assert that the result of a
    particular query produces a particular Inventory. For example, you could
    check your total contributions to an account over a period of time like
    this:

       2018-03-11 assert_query "
         select sum(position)
         where year = 2018
           and account ~ 'Assets:US:Vanguard:Retire:AfterTax:Cash'
           and number > 0" == 27250 USD

  - In the account name completion function in Emacs, don't include the name of
    closed accounts.

  - Ingest should sort the transaction using a secondary "txndate:" metadata
    field and document this somewhere.

  - Idea: Upon an irrecoverable error in the postings, instead of skipping a
    transaction, record it without any postings. This will allow "bean-doctor
    context" to at least find the offending transaction.

  - Idea: Limit the absolute value that can be posted to rounding accounts. The
    limits could be automatically derived from the tolerance values.

  - Integrate the docs from here: https://bitbucket.org/aumayr/beancount

  - Idea to deal with #145: Add all augmenting postings, THEN book all reducing
    ones against that.

  - Full booking: We need an example of two reducing bookings competing for the
    same lot.

  - Implement IPython/Jupyter notebook support for directly viewing the results
    of queries.

  - "bean-doctor linked" should list the list of links that were followed. That
    would go some of the way to explain some of the sometimes surprising
    results.

  - SQL: OpenMeta is different than Meta; it returns a dict. That's bad. Provide
    a direct lookup, like Meta.

  - Complete tests for csv importer; it should be tested frantically, and a
    decent sniffer should be implemented, specifically with credit/debit support
    and balance vs. posting amount support, as well as detecting fees.

  - Add an AVERAGE function to the SQL shell.
    See related discussion, I would like to compute this for myself too:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ledger-cli/dWuWysV6qZU/cyYNzleTCAAJ

  - There ought to be some unit tests for all the custom metadata added to
    Posting instances. I think this is undertested at the moment.

  - Implement a new plugin to convert metadata-fields to Document directives.

      Scan all transactions that have the invoice-metadata field (or any other
    suiting field-name of your choice), and create a Document directive for
    each, with a link to the transaction it comes from.

    In doing so, add support for "fuzzy-matching":  When only a relative
    filename is specified in the metadata-field (and Document directive), search
    different locations based on the Account this is on/in.

    See https://github.com/aumayr/fava/issues/386#issuecomment-256895713.


  - Core: Some problems occur (with the new method) if you mix at-cost and
    without-cost for the same currency, like this:

      2015-09-15 * "Buy"
        Assets:Investments:HOOL   50.795 HOOL {14.63 USD} @ 14.63 USD
        Assets:Investments:Cash   -743.13 USD
        Equity:Vanguard:Rounding

      2015-09-24 * "Dividend Received"
        Assets:Investments:HOOL           0.252 HOOL {14.11 USD} @ 14.11 USD
        Income:Vanguard:Retire:AfterTax:HOOL:Dividend  -3.56 USD
        Equity:Vanguard:Rounding

      2016-05-09 * "Conversion From"
        Assets:Investments:HOOL      -51.047 HOOL @ 14.33 USD
        Assets:Investments:Cash       731.50 USD
        Income:Vanguard:Retire:AfterTax:HOOL:Pnl

      2016-05-10 balance Assets:Investments:HOOL 0 HOOL

      2016-05-10 * "Buy"
        Assets:Investments:HOOL   292.285 HOOL {14.33 USD} @ 14.33 USD
        Assets:Investments:Cash   -4188.44 USD
        Equity:Vanguard:Rounding

    The better way to deal with this would be not to allow it to happen. Because
    this needs to be applied during matching, we cannot implement this in a
    plugin, this needs to become an option (to allow it, and to make it
    disallowed by default) in the parser itself.

  - The Beancount loader cache should be automatically invalidated if the
    revision of Beancount has been updated. This could avoid some potentially
    confusing user interpretation of errors.

  - Idea to deal with #145: Add all augmenting postings, THEN book all reducing
    ones against that.

  - Full booking: We need an example of two reducing bookings competing for the
    same lot.

  - Implement IPython/Jupyter notebook support for directly viewing the results
    of queries.

  - "bean-doctor linked" should list the list of links that were followed. That
    would go some of the way to explain some of the sometimes surprising
    results.

  - SQL: OpenMeta is different than Meta; it returns a dict. That's bad. Provide
    a direct lookup, like Meta.

  - Implement beancount.plugins.auto and beancount.plugins.pedantic finally.

  - You need to add options to provide the precision to use for prices,
    otherwise something like this:

      2016-07-15 * "Resto" "Nice dinner near Storm Hotel" ^b4cd7330bc3d
        Expenses:Food:Restaurants   12500 ISK
        Income:Martin:CreditCard  -103.18 USD @ ISK

    will render as

      2016-07-15 * "Resto" | "Nice dinner near Storm Hotel" ^b4cd7330bc3d
        Expenses:Food:Restaurants:Martin       6250 ISK                ;                           6250 ISK
        Expenses:Food:Restaurants:Caroline     6250 ISK                ;                           6250 ISK
        Income:Martin:CreditCard            -103.18 USD @ 121 ISK      ; -12499.99999999999999999999999 ISK

    instead of

      2016-07-15 * "Resto" | "Nice dinner near Storm Hotel" ^b4cd7330bc3d
        Expenses:Food:Restaurants:Martin       6250 ISK                ;                           6250 ISK
        Expenses:Food:Restaurants:Caroline     6250 ISK                ;                           6250 ISK
        Income:Martin:CreditCard            -103.18 USD @ 121.148 ISK  ; -12499.99999999999999999999999 ISK

    Right now, the only solution is to provide at least one price with a
    suitable precision.

    Another solution, instead of letting the user select the precision, for
    inferred prices, would be to infer maximum precision by default if a digit
    of precision hasn't been seen yet. Round prices shouldn't imply 0 digits of
    precision when it comes to inferred prices, for rendering.

    Note that the actual numbers derived are correct, the only problem is how
    they get rendered by default.

  - Try to modify b.l._parse_recursive() to reuse the DisplayContext object
    across all the parsed files, in order to accumulate its full state. Some
    users (from fava, e.g. Daniel Bos, see thread on mailing-list) are defining
    a single top-level file with only includes, and this breaks the rendering of
    the fractional digits in the web interface in a severe way.

  - Investigate using PrettyTable over my custom one. Is there any point to that?

  - Put all the contents of experiments/ under their own directories and add
    decent README files for each of these.

  - Write a new plugin to spread cash transactions over multiple dates. Use a
    template transaction in the input file as input.

  - Setup continuous integration that would push build status for each commit to
    bitbucket's build status API. Buildbot already has a plugin for this.

  - In upload_assets.py, add the export date somewhere very visible.

  - Convert the upload.py script to use the Sheets v4 API instead of gspread.

  - Produce pivot on monthly expenses as a custom report, the need for this
    occurs too often to wait for the SQL shell to support it.

  - The Beancount presentation should include the table's implicit join,
    graphically, and then explain select/filter/aggregate. Include a section in
    the design doc about this, or perhaps even in its own doc.

  - Add support for the ABC's for the pure interfaces, e.g.
    beancount.prices.sources, beancount.ingest.importers, etc.

  - Start accumulating test cases from real data for similarity classification,
    and rewrite this function from scratch, it just doesn't work well at all.

  - Port all my wash sales scripts to use the new booking method. This ought to
    be working now, with the new booking method.

  - Create an explicit license for my documentation, one that is compatible to
    publishing this as a book later on.

  - BUG: The "bean-doctor context" command does not provide any useful
    information if there was an error on the transaction at context and its
    postings are empty. If we're looking to get the set of lots before and
    after, it's not obvious.

  - Compute and render the difference on a sellgains error. In order to make
    this work, you'll have to implement a difference between inventories.

  - This will fail because of an unfortunate ordering in the transactions on
    the same date:

      2014-08-11 * "Google Massage - 60 minute Table Massage" | "Online purchase"
        Assets:US:GoogleInc:Wallet              -60.00 USD
        Assets:US:GoogleInc:Massage                         120  RUB {0.50 USD}

      2014-08-11 * "Table Massage 60 mins - GB" ^7430817d565c
        Assets:US:GoogleInc:Massage                                        -60 RUB {0.50 USD}
        Expenses:Health:Healing:Massage

    This is normally fixed by fudging the date on the second transaction to 8/12.
    The thing is, we could either

    * Make the check allow a temporary negative balance if on the same date, or
    * Reorder the transactions so that the positive amounts always occur first.
      (I'm not sure that's always possible, imaging a combo of postings that
      requires the opposite order in order for this to work).

    This problem occurs rarely, but when it does, it's annoying to deal with
    because the error removes the transaction and it cascades to more errors.
    Fixing this would help usability a fair amount.

  - This type of interpolation with per-account currency constraints should just work:

      YYYY-MM-DD open Expenses:Communications:Internet  USD
      YYYY-MM-DD open Assets:US:Points:Verizon          VERIPTS

      2017-03-12 * "VERIZON ONETIMEPAY  VERIZON.COM         FL" "PHONE SRV"
        Liabilities:US:CreditCard  -178.37 USD
        Expenses:Communications:Internet
        Income:US:Rewards                -650 VERIPTS
        Assets:US:Points:Verizon

  - You should definitely do some anomaly detection on the list of prices, when
    prices go out of whack with the rest of the time series. I had this happen
    with a rewritten and buggy new price source. This could be done in a plugin
    and would be useful, as invalid prices can manifest in some wildly incorrect
    totals, and this is a common error. Easy with good payoff on correctness.
    Make this part of the pedantic list as well.


** Google Keep Tickets

  - Unicode support: add a basic filter with 'ignore' to a temp file, before I
    finish having a proper lexer. Kick the tires off a lexer anyhow.

  - Idea: select * from transactions, but you have to find a way to
    open/close/clear either before filtering or after.

  - Print out metadata from the C-c x bean-doctor context command

  - Get to a point where you can compute long term vs short term

  - For testing decimal, work the renderers from a given dictionary, either
    computed or given glabally. A maximum should be enforced too.

  - Testing for rendering Needs to test with numbers under prec, over prec,
    integers, with wild prec (enforce max).

  - Add a display_precision option yo allow the user to override it.

  - Add warning on repeated metadata value key

  - Returns: identify entries with intflows + extflows on one transaction,
    without assets, they should be printed out for review in dates after all
    assets accounts are opened

  - Preso: offer an estimate of data size for a ledger and show how its really
    small.

  - Finish prior to spreadsheet replicating g finance

  - Add change from trailing day, week, month, helps making decision based on
    recent trends

  - Idea: introduce balance checks on preso, immediately motivates the de
    method! Highlight errors

  - If I sell my entire position of multiple lots the booking should be able to
    infer that this is umambiguous

  - Don't allow negative units by default--modify STRICT method to disallow
    that.

  - Idea: stock split could be its own directive with a corresponding stream
    transformation, all defined in a plugin

  - Idea: wash adjusents to adjutsment account and zero balance in 2015, instead
    of washing to pnl account. Do this now.

  - Beancount: Review terminology used in documents, use "Clearing" instead of
    "Transfer."

  - Idea: report only on last posting of a transaction!

  - In reading example of stock split, add one that maintains the original
    purchase date

*** Sqltool why interesting ?

  - Automatic schemas
  - Typed calculations
  - Single line
  - Basic operations
  - Running commands

  - Broadcast concept, for inventories
  - Data (..., "html", 1), Html(...)
  - Sources: Beancount, ledger, hledger, CSV, dbm, Xls, xml, etc.

*** Taxes & Finance

  - In Canada, all trading is carried out at average lot! Since when? Adjust my Beancount file.
  - When in foreign land, how much is the base deduction (-93k?) and are you only subject to federal tax rate when you're not there?
  - Q: Can you convert short term gains into long ones via a wash sale?

** File Entries from TODO file
*** Urgent-ish

  - Unify bean-doctor linked and bean-doctor context; make it one, and C-u
    prefix triggers links, perhaps ask for which link

  - Create a demo video about ?context? and ?linked? command-line tools.

  - Add a function to fetch a particular subset of tags with a regular
    expression, e.g. FIRST_REGEXP('award'). Use this on the imported
    stockstatement transactions. This can be used to create a column out of a
    set of tags.

*** Documentation / Process

  - Complete the CA and handle all remaining pull requests and minor bugs.

  - Improve the Lang Syn doc right before the Unused Pad Directives by adding an
    intervening transaction instead of explaining how it works. It would be much
    clearer.

  - Write a doc (video)  that explains how to debug issues, context, linked, print, etc.

*** Branches

  - Finish work on booking branch

  - SQL tool really ought to be extracted away from Beancount, extract as a
    separate project.

*** Small Tasks

  - A large imbalance will appear as a RoundingError, which it shouldn?t!
    RoundingError?s should only be inserted when a transaction balances! Run a
    context on a non-balancing transaction and you?ll see what I mean.

  - Build a script that can list all my cap. gains for tax-loss harvesting.

  - Modify networth script to list post-tax worth, basis + pre-tax value =
    post-tax value, segment based on accounts.

  - Finish that Health Care tracking document.

  - Move over the updating process to Google Spreadsheets solution.

  - Remove all double descriptions in importers in ledgerhub (when payee ==
    narration).

  - beancount-linked is broken, missing line number, and an exception is raised:
    bean-doctor linked blais.beancount 57660; fix this now, rename as
    beancount-context-linked and add a better binding. Use this a lot more.

  - Booking: generate all combinations for just currencies, missing or not, in
    order to complete categorize implementation; (1) apply cost-currency =
    price-currency constraint, (2) infer currency from other legs, (3) infer
    currency from inventory.

  - Define a way to specify output format for rendering many queries, and
    perhaps that should include a Google doc directly that makes an upload, even
    if that has to call out to a Python2 subprocess (that?s fine). Use that
    everywhere.

  - Add ?display_tolerances? rendering override to fix bug with rendering HKD in
    trips, should be mirroring tolerances input syntax. Bug with Beancount:
    journal ?Assets:Caroline:Octopus? does not render with correct precision.

  - Remove unused auto-postings, they distract from the reporting.

  - Deal with flattening now (default should be never to flatten, never render
    empty fields on a continuation line for an inventory) and THEN implement CSV
    rendering.

  - Implement implicit GROUP-BY now.

  - Move ?bean-doctor missing-open? to ?bean-reports missing-open?, this really
    is a report type.

  - Merge 3 newer monnier beancount.el patches.

  - Bug: an unbalanced tag should output a correct line number in the error.
    Right now mistaking push/pop as push/push outputs an error with a zero line
    number, not useful. Need this. Fix this.

  - Complete ultipro tables from PDF parser.

  - payees: train a little model on my payee names to convert them to nice,
    clean payee names. Extract the data now.

  - returns2: Returns revamp + web reports.

  - booking: Implement booking proposal.

  - export: Export to spreadsheets.

  - Document arithmetic operations support

  - Export to Google Spreadsheets: Complete and document how to upload to a Trix

  - Doc on exportpf

  - Conversions: Document how open close clear works. This is really important.
    Use as an important the desire to pre-enter transactions from the future
    (e.g., Jon Stahl?s vesting events).

  - Write Intro with an explanation of open/close/clear.

  - Finish parser cleanup for Unicode.

  - Store residual in metadata, print it out in context

  - ?Transaction does not balance? message should include the tolerance value
    allowed.

  - Complete ?legacy? doc generation (merge assets.asc into that doc, we
    shouldn?t need assets.asc once that?s done, and schematize its contents) And
    start using this.

  - Plugins doc: Add documentation for sellgains plugin in the rest of the docs
    (and of all other plugins).

  - Add a section about Options in the Trading document, with these contents.

  - Implement year close via command-line.

  - Convert dividends to per-stock returns.

  - Wrap up docs? Use the framedocs script?

  - This should be the goto/ project, it should be able to do that.

  - Definitely make a teaching video? this will be useful for applications to
    other things!

  - Write a doc specifically on handling the vesting of shares, including the
    tracking of unvested shares.

  - Write doc on booking taxes NOW.

  - Complete unfinished doc on health care.

  - Convert blais.portfolio to a number of SQL scripts.

  - Why doesn?t ^c2fbec103d99 generate an error?!?
    Ha! It?s because it?s NOT a mixed result? only negatives. Maybe allow only
    positive totals with a different mode, somehow. A constraint on
    dictionaries, another booking method. Maybe that should be the default:
    don?t allow negatives at all.

*** Accounting

  - Measure time taken to find and process documents in ingest and only cache it
    if very long.

  - Document the idea of implementing a virtual SQLite table for Beancount

  - Plan is to support smart sniffers

  - Convert to schema automatically

  - Load them into SQLite tables, or make sources as adapters to virtual tables

  - Add a first step that?s a conversion

*** SQLite

  - Q. Can we invoke arbitrary Python functions from SQLite?

  - Look at termsql & sqlparse

*** Idea for talk

  - Start with a description of all the desired processes and their outputs

  - Then put down the realization: (work to do all of these separately) >>>
    (work to represent all inputs)

  - Black box in the middle of >>>, *THAT*?s what Beancount does

*** Contributor agreement

  - Add this to Beancount contributor agreement notes: CLA:
    https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate

*** Idea

  - Implement a feature that generates a closing + opening transaction to be
    able to split one?s file to multiple files. This should include the currency
    conversions as well.

  - Create a script that splits up a file at a particular date and output two
    files! You should be able to split by date interval, and by tag (to extract
    all the transactions with a particular tag to a separate file).

  - Provide a plugin that summarizes all the balances from transactions marked
    with a particular tag, and replaces those with a single transaction. If all
    the balances are zero, don?t output anything. This could be used to remove
    the opening + closing transactions when including multiple files!

  - Missing account from bean-report balances
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/116/missing-account-from-bean-report-balances

      That's odd indeed. There's some background to this issue; some facts: -
      There are multiple different types of balance reports, they all use a
      different method to determine whether an empty balance account should be
      rendered or not - Some of the criteria include: empty account has had
      entries posted to it during the reporting period, empty account is open,
      empty account has children - I need to review all of those and make them
      consistent.

      I'll leave this ticket open for now and address this in time for your specific
      case. (It's tax-time, so I have a few other features I'm focusing right now
      which I need immediately, will work on this later.)

  - Documents directive with a trailing slash fails; relative path is undocumented
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/120/documents-directive-with-a-trailing-slash

  - Implement a HAVING clause
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/114/implement-having



  - A lot of decimal digits if using total price
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/109/a-lot-of-decimal-digits-if-using-total

      This is an interesting idea I hadn't thought about, basically for the completion
      to round from the most precise until the tolerance fails. I like this. Will
      definitely consider this and implement eventually.

*** Emacs Support

  - Continue patching beancount.el from Stefan's submitted patches:
    https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/14fdc82a04d90565

  - Try it outline-minor-mode to see if I could make Beancount be a major mode
    instead of a minor mode.
    https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/149d363077404909

      From Stefan: "Hmm... so basically as a glorified outline-minor-mode.
      Could you try out outline-minor-mode and tell me what irks you most?"

  - Look into TAB problem:
    https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/14fdc82a04d90565

      "Ben, en fait j'attendais de r?soudre le probl?me du TAB, et pour ?a j'ai
      besoin d'un "recipe" vu que ce que j'ai essay? fonctionne."

  - Make it possible to bean-doctor context on a specific link or tag
    (thing-at-point).

  - Fix amounts alignment function, it always seems to pick up stuff from the
    narration. Make it a fixed column!

** Open Tickets - TODO

  - Issue #130: Padding involving the same account doesn't work incrementally (blais/beancount)

** TaxMin Reporting

  - Read about TaxMin loss harvesting and see if I couldn't implement a similar
    thing in Beancount:

      "Thank you for taking the time to write in and follow up. At this time, there is
      no way to view the full cost basis of all of your holdings at once at
      Betterment.

      Betterment uses a unique algorithm to optimize the tax-efficiency when selling
      shares. You can learn more about our cost basis method for sales here:
      https://www.betterment.com/resources/investment-strategy/taxes/lowering-your-tax-bill-by-improving-our-cost-basis-accounting-methods/

      The same data available on our PDF statements is available for download in CSV
      format. At this time, there is no way to provide more digits of precision in
      that PDF report. If you do transfer funds out of Betterment into another
      brokerage service, your cost basis information will be provided in full to your
      new financial institution upon completion of your transfer."

      --

      "Thank you for writing in about tax loss harvesting. To avoid wash sales,
      Betterment uses a proprietary Parallel Position Management system that utilizes
      secondary securities as a safe harbor to minimize wash sales. Sales will also be
      delayed if recent deposits are made until they are clear of the 30 day wash sale
      window.

      You can find much more information in both our White Paper (see ?Parallel
      Position Management?) and FAQ below:

      In general, you?ll want to avoid investing in any passive ETFs or mutual funds
      that track the same index as the funds in our portfolios. You can check the
      indexes of our investments here.

      TLH+ will automatically manage your purchases when they are made inside your
      Betterment taxable account, as well as your Betterment IRA.

      Target date funds, actively managed funds and individual stocks are generally
      not problematic to use alongside our TLH+ algorithm. To read more about using
      TLH+ with external accounts, please see our guide here.

      Thank you for the feedback regarding exporting data to CSV format, your friend
      is correct. My apologies for the earlier miscommunication; I?ll certainly pass
      your suggestion to our product team.

      Please let us know if you have any additional questions or if we can be of any
      further assistance. Thank you for being a Betterment customer, have a wonderful
      day."

** Adding Types

  Comments from YYing re. adding types:
  https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/140/add-type-annotation-to-beancount-codebase

  - Some bad design choice is more obvious when adding type annotation. E.g.
    https://github.com/yegle/beancount-type-stubs/blob/master/beancount/core/data.pyi#L67
    the tags field of Transcation type is an Optional[Set[str]]. I think it should
    be a Set[str] since an empty set should be sufficient to express "there's no
    tags for this transaction". I'm not sure if there's any difference in turns of
    performance

  - mypy has very limited ability to infer function return types. E.g. functions
    like is_balance_sheet_account in beancount/core/account_types.py, which
    returns foo in bar, mypy is unable to infer that the return type is a bool.
    I think pytype from Google have better type inference but it's written in
    Python2 and I haven't figure out how to run it against python3 code.

** V3-Specific

- Build RE/flex with Boost or PCRE2 with JIT-optimized regexps; see how much of
  a difference it makes; right now it's using the default, which is claimed to
  be faster.
