A double-entry accounting system that uses text files as input.

Beancount defines a simple data format or "language" that lets you
define financial transaction records in a text file, load them in
memory and generate and export a variety of reports, such as balance
sheets or income statements. It also provides a client with an
SQL-like query language to filter and aggregate financial data, and a
web interface which renders those reports to HTML. Finally, it
provides the scaffolding required to automate the conversion of
external data into one's input file in Beancount syntax.""" }
