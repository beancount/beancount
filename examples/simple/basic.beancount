;;; This is a basic example demo file, with some example accounts and
;;; some example transactions. A real-life Ledger file has a lot
;;; more transactions in it, and possibly a very different set
;;; of accounts; feel free to define your own and to change
;;; everything in here if you use this as a template. You can be
;;; creative, because all the account categories and commodities
;;; are entirely generic. (More comments are sprinkled below.)
;;;
;;; The order in which the transactions are declared does not
;;; matter at all... personally I like to organize transactions
;;; in chronological order, within sections that are
;;; more-or-less by account. I normally pretty much keep them in
;;; the order that the converted OFX file presents them. Here
;;; however, I've ordered the transactions for better clarity of
;;; presentation, since this is a file with sample transactions.

;;; Declaration of Accounts.

;;; Here you can declare a list of valid accounts, and
;;; optionally, a constraint on which kind of commodity they are
;;; allowed to hold (helps you track down mistakes).
;;;
;;; Note that
;;;
;;; - the system supports any currencies, and works with
;;;   multiple commodities in the same Ledger.
;;;
;;; - No distinction is made between currency commodities (e.g.
;;;   USD, EUR, USD) and investment commodities (e.g. FB, AMZN,
;;;   AAPL, MSFT).
;;;
;;; - The Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, Expenses
;;;   categories are not special; they are simply a convention;
;;;   be creative if you like. There are really only two kinds
;;;   of accounts: debit accounts and credit accounts, and the
;;;   type is only used for reporting (maybe).

;; Some example trades.
;;
;; - Notice how I like to create a special account to contain
;;   each kind of commodity. This choice is an arbitrary one: I
;;   could keep all the stocks in the one investing account
;;   (which would then contain many different kinds of
;;   commodities) but doing it this way I can more easily track
;;   the book value of the remaining shares that I have. I think
;;   there may be a better way to do this.
;;
;; - Usually I enter the final amounts from the trade
;;   confirmation slips that get emailed to me, because the
;;   information there is more precise and detailed than what I
;;   seem to get from the online brokerage interface. YMMV.
;;
;; - I still don't have a good generic way to deal with the
;;   capital gains automatically, so I enter them by hand for
;;   now. The challenge is to find a generic way to account
;;   for capital gains while accounting for commissions and
;;   trade fees the correct way (they should get removed from the
;;   capital gains at both ends of a trade).
