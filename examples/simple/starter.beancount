;; Starter Kit Example Ledger

* Initialization
;; This is a starter example file that you should copy to get started
;; using Beancount. This is an example starting point, with the same
;; organization choices and style in which I (the author) write my own
;; ledger files. You should delete all these explanatory comments
;; and put your own instead. When you start, the best way to begin is
;; to create one of these, with all your assets and liabilities, so
;; that you can see your balance sheet and your net worth.
;;
;; This example is written from the perspective of someone starting
;; their ledger file on 2013-12-22.
;;
;; This example uses headers in the Emacs outline mode style. Note
;; that you don't have to do that if you don't use Emacs, it's not
;; required, but it's just really convenient if you do, as you can
;; fold and unfold large sections of your input file and get an
;; overview of its structure..
;;
;; The order of directives in the file does not matter. I choose to
;; organize my transactions by-account, mostly. I create one section
;; for each accounts, and above that, I organize sections by country
;; and institution. It's entirely arbitrary, just a choice based on
;; whatever feels most comfortable for you.
;;
;; In this example file the choice of account names follows my own
;; favorite hierarchy:
;;
;; - The type (Assets/Liabilities/Equity/Expense/Income), which
;;   is required by Beancount;
;;
;; - Country. This is useful if you have accounts in multiple places;
;;
;; - Institution. These contain multiple accounts. For example, a
;;   bank has checking and savings accounts, typically. They don't
;;   have to be physical real institution at this level, but I like
;;   to have that level, it's the name of the company that holds the
;;   account, even if the account is fictional.
;;
;; - Account name within the institution.
;;
;; Again, this is entirely arbitrary, but I've evolved into this
;; choice over several years of usage, and I think it's pretty neat.
;; Feel free to elide the country, or design your own account
;; hierarchy, it should work just the same, Beancount does not
;; depend on this choice at all, beyond the first component for the
;; type. Several examples below.

** Options
;; We begin with the declaration of some global options.
;; Run "bean-doctor list_options" for the full list of available options.

option "title" "Starter Kit Beancount Ledger"

;; We will assume this user operates in US dollars.
option "operating_currency" "USD"



** General Accounts
;; We need to declare a few general accounts that we will use below.

;; Declare some sort of account to use as the source for padding
;; entries (see below). Use your birth date... that's when you began
;; accumulating equity!
1982-04-01 open Equity:Opening-Balances

** Events
;; This is a section where I declare some general properties.

;; Enter the date when this address last changed and its curent value.
2008-07-01 event "address" "12345 Brick Lane, New York City, NY 10011, USD"

;; Same thing with your employer.
2011-02-15 event "employer" "Boogle Tech Inc."

;; You can track trips here too by changing the value of a "location"
;; event (variable). Insert one of these every time you travel. It can
;; be used for various purposes (see documentation). You can also
;; choose to put them along your cash expenses somewhere below, which
;; is what I do (remember: the order of declarations in the file is
;; not important).
2013-12-22 event "location" "New York City, USA"


* USA Accounts
** BofA Bank
;; This example individual has some regular accounts in Bank of America
;; (we'll abbreviate as BofA) and a credit card with them.

*** Checking
;; A main checking account.

;; Open the account at the approximate date where you think you
;; actually created it if you don't remember; if you do, find the
;; date and put it here.
;; You don't really have to put a currency constraint, but for a
;; bank account it makes sense to do so, because it really
;; cannot contain any other kinds of beans. This is a US dollar
;; account, so I choose to introduce the "USD" currency here (it's
;; otherwise not pre-defined in any way, it just comes into being
;; as you use it, I could have typed any other all-caps word
;; instead of "USD" here, like "EUR", or "POINTS").
2004-08-01 open Assets:US:BofABank:Checking     USD

;; Then we don't want to have to go and enter all the history from the
;; past here before we get working... so we'll declare a padding
;; directive right at the opening date that will take care of
;; inserting the correct amount to make the following assert balance.
2004-08-01 pad  Assets:US:BofABank:Checking  Equity:Opening-Balances

;; Now insert the balance as of the last date that you have a
;; statement for (or if this is available, you can log into your
;; online account and check that your current account balance is).
2013-12-22 balance  Assets:US:BofABank:Checking   973.03 USD

;; That's it! That is the main template. The rest of this file
;; just follows this example in order to setup all the available
;; accounts. From this point on, you can add or import new
;; transactions following the check date.



*** Savings
;; A high-interest savings account, presumably opened on the same date..

2004-08-01 open   Assets:US:BofABank:Savings  USD
2004-08-01 pad    Assets:US:BofABank:Savings  Equity:Opening-Balances
2013-12-22 balance  Assets:US:BofABank:Savings  2402.81 USD



*** Mortgage
;; A mortgage loan account associated with a Brick Lane property
;; declared below. The date is the same as the purchase of the
;; property, because that's when the mortgage loan began.

2010-03-20 open   Liabilities:US:BofABank:Mortgage  USD

;; Pad this for payments whose detail we won't enter yet.
2010-03-20 pad    Liabilities:US:BofABank:Mortgage  Equity:Opening-Balances

;; Current value of mortgage.
2013-12-22 balance   Liabilities:US:BofABank:Mortgage  -101832.34 USD



** American Express
; He also has an American Express BlueCash Everyday card (we'll
;; abbreviate as Amex).

2009-08-01 open   Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  USD
2009-08-01 pad    Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  Equity:Opening-Balances
2013-12-22 balance  Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  -1121.26 USD



** Fidelity Investments
;; His employer deposits 401k matching amounts in a Fidelity 401k
;; account.

;; Also, note how I create a subaccount for each instrument type
;; being held; this is not strickly necessary, but I like to do this,
;; as it results in nicer output, where each type of instrument has
;; its own journal and it's just overall less messy.
;;
;; Since this is a 401k account and all the amounts deposited are
;; immediately invested, there is no need to declare a Cash account.

2009-08-01 open  Assets:US:Fidelity:Boogle401k:RGAGX  RGAGX

;; Here we just add the contents of the investment account (mutual
;; funds) and their current market value, because this is a registered
;; account (401k) and it is not taxable, so we don't care about the
;; capital gains detail. If you decide later on to add all the
;; purchase transactions, you would find the capital gain appearing.

2013-12-22 price RGAGX  40.93 USD
2013-12-22 price VBMPX  10.02 USD




** E*Trade
;; In addition, he has an E*Trade taxable trading account with some
;; stocks he buys into.

;; In this account, we do have a cash component, which holds our
;; deposits and whose contents is converted against stock during
;; transactions. We pad the cash account to account for past
;; deposits.
2011-03-15 open   Assets:US:ETrade:Investment:Cash  USD

2013-12-22 balance  Assets:US:ETrade:Investment:Cash  102.10 USD


;; These we won't pad; because there's a tax consequence on the
;; capital gain, we want to make sure that we have at least the
;; book value for each position. (Ideally we'd go backwards
;; and enter all the real transactions in the past.)

** Brick Lane Home
;; A while back, he bought a property on Brick Lane. Since there
;; is no stock ticker or currency denomination for "his property,"
;; we'll simply create one as a new symbol: "BRICKHOME" and we'll
;; deposit 1 unit of this home in an account. If he bought another
;; home we would create a different symbol.

;; Now, for a large asset that has been held over a long period of
;; time, it's unlikely that its current value is the same as that
;; it was when it was purchased, so we'll put as a price the most
;; current evaluation.
2013-06-15 price BRICKHOME  210000 USD




* Expenses
;; You should declare a list of buckets for booking expenses into.
;; This is useful in your income statement, to see where your
;; money is going, where it is being spent.
;;
;; I keep all the unused ones commented, because Beancount generates
;; a warning for unused accounts. Uncomment as needed. Because this
;; ledger does not yet contain any history of spending, they're
;; almost all commented out for now.

* Cash Daybook
;; This is a section you can use to enter transactions by hand,
;; that is, not from imported OFX files.




;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; That's it! Run bean-web on this file and you should view a basic
;; balance sheet.
;;
;; Now, the income statement will be sparse and won't reflect the
;; reality of spending and income. You then need to add transactions to
;; it. You can do a few things from here on:
;;
;; 1. You can simply forget all the past history, and begin entering
;;    new transactions from this point onwards.
;;
;; 2. You can decide to enter the details of the past history of
;;    these accounts back to the beginnign of the calendar year.
;;    This provides a good useful starting dataset, because you
;;    will be able to use the ledger to figure out amounts to
;;    declare on your taxes.
;;
;; 3. For some accounts, you may decide to enter all the past history
;;    back to the actual beginning of the account. This would make
;;    sense for your investment accounts, for instance, if you don't
;;    have too many transactions. For each account whose detail has
;;    been fully entered until its beginning, you can delete the
;;    corresponding pad entry.
;;
;;    Depending on how excited you are about this, you might even
;;    choose to try to complete all your accounts a few years back.
;;    It's entirely up to you.
