This directory contains an example for how to initialize and organize your files
to automate your import process. See http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/ingest for
full documentation and discussion of these files. Run the example commands below
in this directory.


Identify the input files under the Downloads directory:

  bean-identify example.import ../Downloads/


Extract transactions from the files in Download/:

  bean-extract -e example.beancount example.import ../Downloads/


File the files from Download/ under document/ (you can run the last command
without moving the files using the -n/--dry-run option):

  bean-file example.import ../Downloads/ -o documents/


To run the regression tests of the custom importers, use the following command:

  nosetests3 --all-modules -v importers/
