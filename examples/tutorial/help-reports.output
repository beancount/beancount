commodities:
    Print out a list of commodities.
prices:
    Print all the prices for a particular commodity.
all_prices:
    Print out the unnormalized price entries that we input. Unnormalized means
    that we may render both (base,quote) and (quote,base). This can be used to
    rebuild a prices database without having to share the entire ledger file.
    Note: this type of report should be removed once we have filtering on
    directive type, this is simply the 'print' report with type:price. Maybe
    rename the 'pricedb' report to just 'prices' for simplicity's sake.
pricedb,pricesdb,prices_db:
    Print out the normalized price entries from the price db. Normalized means
    that we print prices in the most common (base, quote) order. This can be
    used to rebuild a prices database without having to share the entire ledger
    file. Only the forward prices are printed; which (base, quote) pair is
    selected is selected based on the most common occurrence between (base,
    quote) and (quote, base). This is done in the price map.
